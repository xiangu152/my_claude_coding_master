CUSTOMIZE BEHAVIOR
Plugins in the SDK

Load custom plugins to extend Claude Code with skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers through the Agent SDK

Plugins allow you to extend Claude Code with custom functionality that can be shared across projects. Through the Agent SDK, you can programmatically load plugins from local directories to add skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers to your agent sessions.

What are plugins?
Plugins are packages of Claude Code extensions that can include:
Skills: Model-invoked capabilities that Claude uses autonomously (can also be invoked with /skill-name)
Agents: Specialized subagents for specific tasks
Hooks: Event handlers that respond to tool use and other events
MCP servers: External tool integrations via Model Context Protocol
The commands/ directory is a legacy format. Use skills/ for new plugins. Claude Code continues to support both formats for backward compatibility.
For complete information on plugin structure and how to create plugins, see Plugins.

Loading plugins
Load plugins by providing their local file system paths in your options configuration. The type field must be "local", the only value the SDK accepts. To use a plugin distributed through a marketplace or remote repository, download it first and provide the local directory path. The SDK supports loading multiple plugins from different locations.
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Hello",
  options: {
    plugins: [
      { type: "local", path: "./my-plugin" },
      { type: "local", path: "/absolute/path/to/another-plugin" }
    ]
  }
})) {
  // Plugin commands, agents, and other features are now available
}


Path specifications
Plugin paths can be:
Relative paths: Resolved relative to your current working directory (for example, "./plugins/my-plugin")
Absolute paths: Full file system paths (for example, "/home/user/plugins/my-plugin")
The path should point to the plugin’s root directory: the parent of skills/, agents/, hooks/, commands/ (legacy), or .claude-plugin/, not a subdirectory.

Verifying plugin installation
When plugins load successfully, they appear in the system initialization message. You can verify that your plugins are available:
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Hello",
  options: {
    plugins: [{ type: "local", path: "./my-plugin" }]
  }
})) {
  if (message.type === "system" && message.subtype === "init") {
    // Check loaded plugins
    console.log("Plugins:", message.plugins);
    // Example: [{ name: "my-plugin", path: "./my-plugin" }]

```python
    // Plugin skills appear with the plugin name as a prefix
    console.log("Skills:", message.skills);
    // Example: ["my-plugin:greet"]
```

    // Plugin commands use the same prefix, and skills appear here too
    console.log("Commands:", message.slash_commands);
    // Example: ["compact", "context", "my-plugin:custom-command", "my-plugin:greet"]
  }
}


Using plugin skills
Skills from plugins are automatically namespaced with the plugin name to avoid conflicts. To invoke one directly, send /plugin-name:skill-name as the prompt.
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

// Load a plugin with a custom /greet skill
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "/my-plugin:greet", // Use plugin skill with namespace
  options: {
    plugins: [{ type: "local", path: "./my-plugin" }]
  }
})) {
  // Claude executes the custom greeting skill from the plugin
  if (message.type === "assistant") {
    console.log(message.message.content);
  }
}

If you installed a plugin via the CLI (for example, /plugin install my-plugin@marketplace), you can still use it in the SDK by providing its installation path. Check ~/.claude/plugins/ for CLI-installed plugins.

Complete example
Here’s a full example demonstrating plugin loading and usage:
```python
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";
import * as path from "path";
```

async function runWithPlugin() {
  const pluginPath = path.join(__dirname, "plugins", "my-plugin");

  console.log("Loading plugin from:", pluginPath);

  for await (const message of query({
    prompt: "What custom commands do you have available?",
    options: {
      plugins: [{ type: "local", path: pluginPath }],
      maxTurns: 3
    }
  })) {
```python
    if (message.type === "system" && message.subtype === "init") {
      console.log("Loaded plugins:", message.plugins);
      console.log("Available skills:", message.skills);
      console.log("Available commands:", message.slash_commands);
    }
```

```python
    if (message.type === "assistant") {
      console.log("Assistant:", message.message.content);
    }
```
  }
}

runWithPlugin().catch(console.error);


Plugin structure reference
A plugin directory typically contains a .claude-plugin/plugin.json manifest file. The manifest is optional. When omitted, Claude Code auto-discovers components from the directory layout. The directory can include:
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Plugin manifest (optional, components auto-discovered without it)
├── skills/                   # Agent Skills (invoked autonomously or via /skill-name)
│   └── my-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── commands/                 # Legacy: use skills/ instead
│   └── custom-cmd.md
├── agents/                   # Custom agents
│   └── specialist.md
├── hooks/                    # Event handlers
│   └── hooks.json
└── .mcp.json                # MCP server definitions

Plugins - Complete plugin development guide
Plugins reference - Technical specifications and schemas

Common use cases

Development and testing
Load plugins during development without installing them globally:
plugins: [{ type: "local", path: "./dev-plugins/my-plugin" }];


Project-specific extensions
Include plugins in your project repository for team-wide consistency:
plugins: [{ type: "local", path: "./project-plugins/team-workflows" }];


Multiple plugin sources
Combine plugins from different locations:
plugins: [
  { type: "local", path: "./local-plugin" },
  { type: "local", path: "~/.claude/custom-plugins/shared-plugin" }
];


Troubleshooting

Plugin not loading
If your plugin doesn’t appear in the init message:
Check the path: ensure the path points to the plugin root directory, the parent of skills/, agents/, hooks/, commands/ (legacy), or .claude-plugin/
Validate plugin.json: if your plugin includes a manifest, ensure it has valid JSON syntax
Check file permissions: ensure the plugin directory is readable

Skills not appearing
If plugin skills don’t work:
Use the namespace: invoke plugin skills as /plugin-name:skill-name
Check init message: verify the skill appears in the skills list with the correct namespace
Validate skill files: ensure each skill has a SKILL.md file in its own subdirectory under skills/, for example skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

Path resolution issues
If relative paths don’t work:
Check working directory: Relative paths are resolved from your current working directory
Use absolute paths: For reliability, consider using absolute paths
Normalize paths: Use path utilities to construct paths correctly
