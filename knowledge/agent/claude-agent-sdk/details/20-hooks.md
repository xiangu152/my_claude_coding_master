Intercept and control agent behavior with hooks

Intercept and customize agent behavior at key execution points with hooks

Hooks are callback functions that run your code in response to agent events, like a tool being called, a session starting, or execution stopping. With hooks, you can:
Block dangerous operations before they execute, like destructive shell commands or unauthorized file access
Log and audit every tool call for compliance, debugging, or analytics
Transform inputs and outputs to sanitize data, inject credentials, or redirect file paths
Require human approval for sensitive actions like database writes or API calls
Track session lifecycle to manage state, clean up resources, or send notifications
This guide covers how hooks work and how to configure them, with examples for common patterns like blocking tools, modifying inputs, and forwarding notifications.

How hooks work
1

An event fires

Something happens during agent execution and the SDK fires an event: a tool is about to be called (PreToolUse), a tool returned a result (PostToolUse), a subagent started or stopped, the agent is idle, or execution finished. See the full list of events.
2

The SDK collects registered hooks

The SDK checks for hooks registered for that event type. This includes callback hooks you pass in options.hooks and shell command hooks from settings files when the corresponding settingSources or setting_sources entry is enabled, which it is for default query() options.
3

Matchers filter which hooks run

If a hook has a matcher pattern (like "Write|Edit"), the SDK tests it against the event’s target (for example, the tool name). Hooks without a matcher run for every event of that type.
4

Callback functions execute

Each matching hook’s callback function receives input about what’s happening: the tool name, its arguments, the session ID, and other event-specific details.
5

Your callback returns a decision

After performing any operations (logging, API calls, validation), your callback returns an output object that tells the agent what to do: allow the operation, block it, modify the input, or inject context into the conversation.
The following example puts these steps together. It registers a PreToolUse hook (step 1) with a "Write|Edit" matcher (step 3) so the callback only fires for file-writing tools. When triggered, the callback receives the tool’s input (step 4), checks if the file path targets a .env file, and returns permissionDecision: "deny" to block the operation (step 5):
```python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import (
    AssistantMessage,
    ClaudeSDKClient,
    ClaudeAgentOptions,
    HookMatcher,
    ResultMessage,
```
)


# Define a hook callback that receives tool call details
```python
async def protect_env_files(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
    # Extract the file path from the tool's input arguments
    file_path = input_data["tool_input"].get("file_path", "")
    file_name = file_path.split("/")[-1]
```

```python
    # Block the operation if targeting a .env file
    if file_name == ".env":
        return {
            "hookSpecificOutput": {
                "hookEventName": input_data["hook_event_name"],
                "permissionDecision": "deny",
                "permissionDecisionReason": "Cannot modify .env files",
            }
        }
```

```python
    # Return empty object to allow the operation
    return {}
```


```python
async def main():
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        hooks={
            # Register the hook for PreToolUse events
            # The matcher filters to only Write and Edit tool calls
            "PreToolUse": [HookMatcher(matcher="Write|Edit", hooks=[protect_env_files])]
        }
    )
```

```python
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
        await client.query("Update the database configuration")
        async for message in client.receive_response():
            # Filter for assistant and result messages
            if isinstance(message, (AssistantMessage, ResultMessage)):
                print(message)
```


asyncio.run(main())


Available hooks
The SDK provides hooks for different stages of agent execution. Some hooks are available in both SDKs, while others are TypeScript-only.
| Hook Event | Python SDK | TypeScript SDK | What triggers it | Example use case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PreToolUse | Yes | Yes | Tool call request (can block or modify) | Block dangerous shell commands |
| PostToolUse | Yes | Yes | Tool execution result | Log all file changes to audit trail |
| PostToolUseFailure | Yes | Yes | Tool execution failure | Handle or log tool errors |
| PostToolBatch | No | Yes | A full batch of tool calls resolves, once per batch before the next model call | Inject conventions once for the whole batch |
| UserPromptSubmit | Yes | Yes | User prompt submission | Inject additional context into prompts |
| MessageDisplay | No | Yes | An assistant message with text completes, once per message with the full message text | Redact or reformat the displayed text without changing the transcript |
| Stop | Yes | Yes | Agent execution stop | Save session state before exit |
| SubagentStart | Yes | Yes | Subagent initialization | Track parallel task spawning |
| SubagentStop | Yes | Yes | Subagent completion | Aggregate results from parallel tasks |
| PreCompact | Yes | Yes | Conversation compaction request | Archive full transcript before summarizing |
| PermissionRequest | Yes | Yes | Permission dialog would be displayed | Custom permission handling |
| SessionStart | No | Yes | Session initialization | Initialize logging and telemetry |
| SessionEnd | No | Yes | Session termination | Clean up temporary resources |
| Notification | Yes | Yes | Agent status messages | Send agent status updates to Slack or PagerDuty |
| Setup | No | Yes | Session setup/maintenance | Run initialization tasks |
| TeammateIdle | No | Yes | Teammate becomes idle | Reassign work or notify |
| TaskCompleted | No | Yes | Background task completes | Aggregate results from parallel tasks |
| ConfigChange | No | Yes | Configuration file changes | Reload settings dynamically |
| WorktreeCreate | No | Yes | Git worktree created | Track isolated workspaces |
| WorktreeRemove | No | Yes | Git worktree removed | Clean up workspace resources |

Configure hooks
To configure a hook, pass it in the hooks field of your agent options (ClaudeAgentOptions in Python, the options object in TypeScript):
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    hooks={"PreToolUse": [HookMatcher(matcher="Bash", hooks=[my_callback])]}
)

async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
```python
    await client.query("Your prompt")
    async for message in client.receive_response():
        print(message)
```

The hooks option is a dictionary in Python or an object in TypeScript, where:
Keys: hook event names such as 'PreToolUse', 'PostToolUse', and 'Stop'
Values: arrays of matchers, each containing an optional filter pattern and your callback functions

Matchers
Use matchers to filter when your callbacks fire. The matcher field matches against a different value depending on the hook event type. For example, tool-based hooks match against the tool name, while Notification hooks match against the notification type. See the Claude Code hooks reference for the full list of matcher values for each event type.
SDK matchers follow the same rules as matchers in settings files. A matcher containing only letters, digits, _, -, spaces, ,, and | is compared as an exact string, with alternatives separated by | or , and optional surrounding whitespace, so Write|Edit and Write, Edit each match exactly those two tools and code-reviewer matches only that agent type. A matcher of *, an empty string, or omitting the matcher entirely matches every occurrence of the event.
A matcher containing any other character is evaluated as an unanchored regular expression, so ^mcp__ matches every MCP tool and Edit.* matches both Edit and NotebookEdit. Wrap a regular expression in ^ and $ when you need a whole-string match.
A matcher like mcp__memory or mcp__brave-search contains only exact-match characters, so it is compared as an exact string and matches no tool; use mcp__memory__.* to match every tool from that server.
Hyphens in the exact-match set require a Claude Code runtime of v2.1.195 or later. On earlier versions a hyphenated name like code-reviewer is evaluated as an unanchored regular expression and must be anchored as ^code-reviewer$ to match exactly.
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| matcher | string | undefined | Pattern matched against the event’s filter field, following the comparison rules above. For tool hooks, this is the tool name. Built-in tools include Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, Agent, and others (see Tool Input Types for the full list). MCP tools use the pattern mcp__<server>__<action>. |
| hooks | HookCallback[] | - | Required. Array of callback functions to execute when the pattern matches |
| timeout | number | 60 | Timeout in seconds |
Use the matcher pattern to target specific tools whenever possible. A matcher with 'Bash' only runs for Bash commands, while omitting the pattern runs your callbacks for every occurrence of the event.
For tool-based hooks, matchers only filter by tool name, not by file paths or other arguments. To filter by file path, check tool_input.file_path inside your callback.
Discovering tool names: See Tool Input Types for the full list of built-in tool names, or add a hook without a matcher to log all tool calls your session makes.
MCP tool naming: MCP tools always start with mcp__ followed by the server name and action: mcp__<server>__<action>. For example, if you configure a server named playwright, its tools are named mcp__playwright__browser_screenshot, mcp__playwright__browser_click, and so on. The server name comes from the key you use in the mcpServers configuration.

Callback functions

Inputs
Every hook callback receives three arguments:
Input data: a typed object containing event details. Each hook type has its own input shape. For example, PreToolUseHookInput includes tool_name and tool_input, while NotificationHookInput includes message. See the full type definitions in the TypeScript and Python SDK references.
All hook inputs share session_id, cwd, and hook_event_name.
agent_id and agent_type are populated when the hook fires inside a subagent. In TypeScript, these are on the base hook input and available to all hook types. In Python, they are on PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and PostToolUseFailure only.
Tool use ID (str | None / string | undefined): correlates PreToolUse and PostToolUse events for the same tool call.
Context: in TypeScript, contains a signal property (AbortSignal) for cancellation. In Python, this argument is reserved for future use.

Outputs
Your callback returns an object with two categories of fields:
Top-level fields work the same on every event: systemMessage shows a message to the user, and continue (continue_ in Python) determines whether the agent keeps running after this hook.
hookSpecificOutput controls the current operation. The fields inside depend on the hook event type. For PreToolUse hooks, this is where you set permissionDecision ("allow", "deny", "ask", or "defer"), permissionDecisionReason, and updatedInput. Returning "defer" ends the query so you can resume it later. For PostToolUse hooks, you can set additionalContext to append information to the tool result. To replace the tool’s output before Claude sees it, set updatedToolOutput, which works for any tool in both SDKs. The older updatedMCPToolOutput field replaces MCP tool output only and is deprecated.
Return {} to allow the operation without changes. SDK callback hooks use the same JSON output format as Claude Code shell command hooks, which documents every field and event-specific option. For the SDK type definitions, see the TypeScript and Python SDK references.
When multiple hooks or permission rules apply, deny takes priority over defer, which takes priority over ask, which takes priority over allow. If any hook returns deny, the operation is blocked regardless of other hooks.

Asynchronous output
By default, the agent waits for your hook to return before proceeding. If your hook performs a side effect, such as logging or sending a webhook, and doesn’t need to influence the agent’s behavior, you can return an async output instead. This tells the agent to continue immediately without waiting for the hook to finish:
```python
async def async_hook(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
    # Start a background task, then return immediately
    asyncio.create_task(send_to_logging_service(input_data))
    return {"async_": True, "asyncTimeout": 30000}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| async | true | Signals async mode. The agent proceeds without waiting. In Python, use async_ to avoid the reserved keyword. |
| asyncTimeout | number | Optional timeout in milliseconds for the background operation |
Async outputs can’t block, modify, or inject context into the operation since the agent has already moved on. Use them only for side effects like logging, metrics, or notifications.

Examples

Modify tool input
This example intercepts Write tool calls and rewrites the file_path argument to prepend /sandbox, redirecting all file writes to a sandboxed directory. The callback returns updatedInput with the modified path and permissionDecision: 'allow' to auto-approve the rewritten operation:
```python
async def redirect_to_sandbox(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
    if input_data["hook_event_name"] != "PreToolUse":
        return {}
```

```python
    if input_data["tool_name"] == "Write":
        original_path = input_data["tool_input"].get("file_path", "")
        return {
            "hookSpecificOutput": {
                "hookEventName": input_data["hook_event_name"],
                "permissionDecision": "allow",
                "updatedInput": {
```
                    **input_data["tool_input"],
```python
                    "file_path": f"/sandbox{original_path}",
                },
            }
        }
    return {}
```

When using updatedInput, you must also include permissionDecision: 'allow' to auto-approve the modified input or permissionDecision: 'ask' to show it to the user. With 'defer', updatedInput is ignored. Always return a new object rather than mutating the original tool_input.

Add context and block a tool
This example blocks writes to the /etc directory and explains why to both the model and the user:
permissionDecision: 'deny' stops the tool call.
permissionDecisionReason tells the model why, so it avoids retrying.
systemMessage shows the user what happened.
```python
async def block_etc_writes(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
    file_path = input_data["tool_input"].get("file_path", "")
```

```python
    if file_path.startswith("/etc"):
        return {
            # Top-level field: message shown to the user
            "systemMessage": "Remember: system directories like /etc are protected.",
            # hookSpecificOutput: block the operation
            "hookSpecificOutput": {
                "hookEventName": input_data["hook_event_name"],
                "permissionDecision": "deny",
                "permissionDecisionReason": "Writing to /etc is not allowed",
            },
        }
    return {}
```


Auto-approve specific tools
By default, the agent may prompt for permission before using certain tools. This example auto-approves read-only filesystem tools (Read, Glob, Grep) by returning permissionDecision: 'allow', letting them run without user confirmation while leaving all other tools subject to normal permission checks:
```python
async def auto_approve_read_only(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
    if input_data["hook_event_name"] != "PreToolUse":
        return {}
```

```python
    read_only_tools = ["Read", "Glob", "Grep"]
    if input_data["tool_name"] in read_only_tools:
        return {
            "hookSpecificOutput": {
                "hookEventName": input_data["hook_event_name"],
                "permissionDecision": "allow",
                "permissionDecisionReason": "Read-only tool auto-approved",
            }
        }
    return {}
```


Register multiple hooks
When an event fires, all matching hooks run in parallel. For permission decisions, the most restrictive result applies: a single deny blocks the tool call regardless of what the other hooks return. Because completion order is non-deterministic, write each hook to act independently rather than relying on another hook having run first.
The example below registers three independent checks for every tool call:
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    hooks={
        "PreToolUse": [
            HookMatcher(hooks=[authorization_check]),
            HookMatcher(hooks=[input_validator]),
            HookMatcher(hooks=[audit_logger]),
        ]
    }
)


Filter with multi-tool matchers
Use multi-tool matchers to share one callback across related tools. This example registers three matchers with different scopes:
A pipe-separated exact list (Write|Edit|Delete) triggers file_security_hook only for file modification tools.
A regex (^mcp__) triggers mcp_audit_hook for any MCP tool whose name starts with mcp__.
An omitted matcher triggers global_logger for every tool call regardless of name.
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    hooks={
        "PreToolUse": [
            # Match file modification tools
            HookMatcher(matcher="Write|Edit|Delete", hooks=[file_security_hook]),
            # Match all MCP tools
            HookMatcher(matcher="^mcp__", hooks=[mcp_audit_hook]),
            # Match everything (no matcher)
            HookMatcher(hooks=[global_logger]),
        ]
    }
)


Track subagent activity
Use SubagentStop hooks to monitor when subagents finish their work. See the full input type in the TypeScript and Python SDK references. This example logs a summary each time a subagent completes:
```python
async def subagent_tracker(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
    # Log subagent details when it finishes
    print(f"[SUBAGENT] Completed: {input_data['agent_id']}")
    print(f"  Transcript: {input_data['agent_transcript_path']}")
    print(f"  Tool use ID: {tool_use_id}")
    print(f"  Stop hook active: {input_data.get('stop_hook_active')}")
    return {}
```


options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    hooks={"SubagentStop": [HookMatcher(hooks=[subagent_tracker])]}
)


Make HTTP requests from hooks
Hooks can perform asynchronous operations like HTTP requests. Catch errors inside your hook instead of letting them propagate, since an unhandled exception can interrupt the agent.
This example sends a webhook after each tool completes, logging which tool ran and when. The hook catches errors so a failed webhook doesn’t interrupt the agent:
```python
import asyncio
import json
import urllib.request
from datetime import datetime
```


```python
def _send_webhook(tool_name):
    """Synchronous helper that POSTs tool usage data to an external webhook."""
    data = json.dumps(
        {
            "tool": tool_name,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        }
    ).encode()
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        "https://api.example.com/webhook",
        data=data,
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        method="POST",
    )
    urllib.request.urlopen(req)
```


```python
async def webhook_notifier(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
    # Only fire after a tool completes (PostToolUse), not before
    if input_data["hook_event_name"] != "PostToolUse":
        return {}
```

```python
    try:
        # Run the blocking HTTP call in a thread to avoid blocking the event loop
        await asyncio.to_thread(_send_webhook, input_data["tool_name"])
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error but don't raise. A failed webhook shouldn't stop the agent
        print(f"Webhook request failed: {e}")
```

    return {}


Forward notifications to Slack
Use Notification hooks to receive system notifications from the agent and forward them to external services. Notifications fire for event types such as:
permission_prompt when Claude needs permission
idle_prompt when Claude is waiting for input
auth_success when authentication completes
elicitation_dialog, elicitation_complete, and elicitation_response for user-prompt elicitation flows
Each notification includes a message field with a human-readable description and optionally a title.
This example forwards every notification to a Slack channel. It requires a Slack incoming webhook URL, which you create by adding an app to your Slack workspace and enabling incoming webhooks:
```python
import asyncio
import json
import urllib.request
```

from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions, HookMatcher


```python
def _send_slack_notification(message):
    """Synchronous helper that sends a message to Slack via incoming webhook."""
    data = json.dumps({"text": f"Agent status: {message}"}).encode()
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL",
        data=data,
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        method="POST",
    )
    urllib.request.urlopen(req)
```


```python
async def notification_handler(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
    try:
        # Run the blocking HTTP call in a thread to avoid blocking the event loop
        await asyncio.to_thread(_send_slack_notification, input_data.get("message", ""))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send notification: {e}")
```

```python
    # Return empty object. Notification hooks don't modify agent behavior
    return {}
```


```python
async def main():
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        hooks={
            # Register the hook for Notification events (no matcher needed)
            "Notification": [HookMatcher(hooks=[notification_handler])],
        },
    )
```

```python
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
        await client.query("Analyze this codebase")
        async for message in client.receive_response():
            print(message)
```


asyncio.run(main())


Fix common issues

Hook not firing
Verify the hook event name is correct and case-sensitive (PreToolUse, not preToolUse)
Check that your matcher pattern matches the tool name exactly
Ensure the hook is under the correct event type in options.hooks
For non-tool hooks that support matchers, like Notification and SubagentStop, matchers match against different fields, and Stop ignores matchers entirely (see matcher patterns)
Hooks may not fire when the agent hits the max_turns limit because the session ends before hooks can execute

Matcher not filtering as expected
Matchers only match tool names, not file paths or other arguments. To filter by file path, check tool_input.file_path inside your hook:
const myHook: HookCallback = async (input, toolUseID, { signal }) => {
  const preInput = input as PreToolUseHookInput;
  const toolInput = preInput.tool_input as Record<string, unknown>;
  const filePath = toolInput?.file_path as string;
  if (!filePath?.endsWith(".md")) return {}; // Skip non-markdown files
  // Process markdown files...
  return {};
};


Hook timeout
Increase the timeout value in the HookMatcher configuration
Use the AbortSignal from the third callback argument to handle cancellation gracefully in TypeScript

Tool blocked unexpectedly
Check all PreToolUse hooks for permissionDecision: 'deny' returns
Add logging to your hooks to see what permissionDecisionReason they’re returning
Verify matcher patterns aren’t too broad: an empty matcher matches all tools

Modified input not applied
Ensure updatedInput is inside hookSpecificOutput, not at the top level:
return {
  hookSpecificOutput: {
    hookEventName: "PreToolUse",
    permissionDecision: "allow",
    updatedInput: { command: "new command" }
  }
};

Return permissionDecision: 'allow' to auto-approve the modified input, or 'ask' to show it to the user for approval
Include hookEventName in hookSpecificOutput to identify which hook type the output is for

Session hooks not available in Python
SessionStart and SessionEnd can be registered as SDK callback hooks in TypeScript, but aren’t available in the Python SDK because its HookEvent type omits them. In Python, they are only available as shell command hooks defined in settings files such as .claude/settings.json. To load shell command hooks from your SDK application, include the appropriate setting source with setting_sources or settingSources:
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    setting_sources=["project"],  # Loads .claude/settings.json including hooks
)

To run initialization logic as a Python SDK callback instead, use the first message from client.receive_response() as your trigger.

Subagent permission prompts multiplying
When spawning multiple subagents, each one may request permissions separately. Subagents don’t automatically inherit parent agent permissions. To avoid repeated prompts, use PreToolUse hooks to auto-approve specific tools, or configure permission rules that apply to subagent sessions.

Recursive hook loops with subagents
A UserPromptSubmit hook that spawns subagents can create infinite loops if those subagents trigger the same hook. To prevent this:
Check for a subagent indicator in the hook input before spawning
Use a shared variable or session state to track whether you’re already inside a subagent
Scope hooks to only run for the top-level agent session

systemMessage not appearing in output
The systemMessage field shows a message to the user, not the model. By default the SDK doesn’t surface hook output in the message stream, so the message may not appear unless you set includeHookEvents (include_hook_events in Python). To pass context to the model instead, return additionalContext.
If you need to surface hook decisions to your application reliably, log them separately or use a dedicated output channel.
