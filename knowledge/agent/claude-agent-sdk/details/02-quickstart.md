Quickstart

Get started with the Python or TypeScript Agent SDK to build AI agents that work autonomously

Use the Agent SDK to build an AI agent that reads your code, finds bugs, and fixes them, all without manual intervention.
What you’ll do:
Set up a project with the Agent SDK
Create a file with some buggy code
Run an agent that finds and fixes the bugs automatically

Prerequisites
Node.js 18+ or Python 3.10+
An Anthropic account (sign up here)

Setup
1

Create a project folder

Create a new directory for this quickstart:
mkdir my-agent
cd my-agent

For your own projects, you can run the SDK from any folder; it will have access to files in that directory and its subdirectories by default.
2

Install the SDK

Install the Agent SDK package for your language:
TypeScript (new project)
TypeScript (existing project)
Python (uv)
Python (pip)
npm init -y
npm pkg set type=module
npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
npm install --save-dev tsx

Setting "type": "module" in package.json lets your agent script use top-level await, and tsx runs TypeScript files directly.
The TypeScript SDK bundles a native Claude Code binary for your platform as an optional dependency, so you don’t need to install Claude Code separately.
3

Set your API key

Get an API key from the Claude Console, then set it as an environment variable in the shell where you’ll run your agent:
macOS / Linux
Windows (PowerShell)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key

The SDK reads the key from the environment of the process that runs your agent; it doesn’t load .env files automatically. If you keep the key in a .env file, load it yourself, for example with the dotenv package, before calling the SDK.
The SDK also supports authentication via third-party API providers:
Amazon Bedrock: set CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1 environment variable and configure AWS credentials
Claude Platform on AWS: set CLAUDE_CODE_USE_ANTHROPIC_AWS=1 and ANTHROPIC_AWS_WORKSPACE_ID, then configure AWS credentials
Google Cloud’s Agent Platform: set CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1 environment variable and configure Google Cloud credentials
Microsoft Azure: set CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1 environment variable and configure Azure credentials
See the setup guides for Amazon Bedrock, Claude Platform on AWS, Google Cloud’s Agent Platform, or Microsoft Foundry for details.
Unless previously approved, Anthropic does not allow third party developers to offer claude.ai login or rate limits for their products, including agents built on the Claude Agent SDK. Please use the API key authentication methods described in this document instead.

Create a buggy file
This quickstart walks you through building an agent that can find and fix bugs in code. First, you need a file with some intentional bugs for the agent to fix. Create utils.py in the my-agent directory and paste the following code:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)
```


```python
def get_user_name(user):
    return user["name"].upper()
```

This code has two bugs:
calculate_average([]) crashes with division by zero
get_user_name(None) crashes with a TypeError

Build an agent that finds and fixes bugs
Create agent.py if you’re using the Python SDK, or agent.ts for TypeScript. Use agent.mts instead if your existing project uses CommonJS:
```python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, AssistantMessage, ResultMessage
```


```python
async def main():
    # Agentic loop: streams messages as Claude works
    async for message in query(
        prompt="Review utils.py for bugs that would cause crashes. Fix any issues you find.",
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
            allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Glob"],  # Auto-approve these tools
            permission_mode="acceptEdits",  # Auto-approve file edits
        ),
    ):
        # Print human-readable output
        if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
            for block in message.content:
                if hasattr(block, "text"):
                    print(block.text)  # Claude's reasoning
                elif hasattr(block, "name"):
                    print(f"Tool: {block.name}")  # Tool being called
        elif isinstance(message, ResultMessage):
            print(f"Done: {message.subtype}")  # Final result
```


asyncio.run(main())

This code has three main parts:
query: the main entry point that creates the agentic loop. It returns an async iterator, so you use async for to stream messages as Claude works. See the full API in the Python or TypeScript SDK reference.
prompt: what you want Claude to do. Claude figures out which tools to use based on the task.
options: configuration for the agent. This example uses allowedTools to pre-approve Read, Edit, and Glob, and permissionMode: "acceptEdits" to auto-approve file changes. Other options include systemPrompt, mcpServers, and more. See all options for Python or TypeScript.
The async for loop keeps running as Claude thinks, calls tools, observes results, and decides what to do next. Each iteration yields a message: Claude’s reasoning, a tool call, a tool result, or the final outcome. The SDK handles the orchestration (tool execution, context management, retries) so you just consume the stream. The loop ends when Claude finishes the task or hits an error.
The message handling inside the loop filters for human-readable output. Without filtering, you’d see raw message objects including system initialization and internal state, which is useful for debugging but noisy otherwise.
This example uses streaming to show progress in real-time. If you don’t need live output (e.g., for background jobs or CI pipelines), you can collect all messages at once. See Streaming vs. single-turn mode for details.

Run your agent
Your agent is ready. Run it with the following command:
Python (uv)
Python (pip)
npx tsx agent.ts

If you named your script agent.mts, run npx tsx agent.mts instead.
As it works, the agent prints its reasoning and each tool it calls, ending with Done: success. After running, check utils.py. You’ll see defensive code handling empty lists and null users. Your agent autonomously:
Read utils.py to understand the code
Analyzed the logic and identified edge cases that would crash
Edited the file to add proper error handling
This is what makes the Agent SDK different: Claude executes tools directly instead of asking you to implement them.
If you see “API key not found”, make sure you’ve set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable in the shell where you run your agent. The SDK doesn’t load .env files automatically. See the full troubleshooting guide for more help.

Try other prompts
Now that your agent is set up, try some different prompts:
"Add docstrings to all functions in utils.py"
"Add type hints to all functions in utils.py"
"Create a README.md documenting the functions in utils.py"

Customize your agent
You can modify your agent’s behavior by changing the options. Here are a few examples:
Add web search capability:
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Glob", "WebSearch"], permission_mode="acceptEdits"
)

Give Claude a custom system prompt:
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Glob"],
    permission_mode="acceptEdits",
    system_prompt="You are a senior Python developer. Always follow PEP 8 style guidelines.",
)

Run commands in the terminal:
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Glob", "Bash"], permission_mode="acceptEdits"
)

With Bash enabled, try: "Write unit tests for utils.py, run them, and fix any failures"

Key concepts
Tools control what your agent can do:
Tools	What the agent can do
Read, Glob, Grep	Read-only analysis
Read, Edit, Glob	Analyze and modify code
Read, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep	Full automation
Permission modes control how much human oversight you want:
| Mode | Behavior | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| acceptEdits | Auto-approves file edits and common filesystem commands, asks for other actions | Trusted development workflows |
| plan | Runs read-only tools; file edits are never auto-approved and reach your canUseTool callback | Scoping a task before approving execution |
| dontAsk | Denies anything not in allowedTools | Locked-down headless agents |
| auto (TypeScript only) | A model classifier approves or denies each tool call | Autonomous agents with safety guardrails |
| bypassPermissions | Runs every tool without prompting, unless an explicit ask rule matches | Sandboxed CI, fully trusted environments |
| default | Requires a canUseTool callback to handle approval | Custom approval flows |
The example above uses acceptEdits mode, which auto-approves file operations so the agent can run without interactive prompts. If you want to prompt users for approval, use default mode and provide a canUseTool callback that collects user input. For more control, see Permissions.

Now that you’ve created your first agent, learn how to extend its capabilities and tailor it to your use case:
Permissions: control what your agent can do and when it needs approval
Hooks: run custom code before or after tool calls
Sessions: build multi-turn agents that maintain context
MCP servers: connect to databases, browsers, APIs, and other external systems
Hosting: deploy agents to Docker, cloud, and CI/CD
Example agents: see complete examples: email assistant, research agent, and more
