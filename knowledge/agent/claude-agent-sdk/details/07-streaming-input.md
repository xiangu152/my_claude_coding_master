Understanding the two input modes for Claude Agent SDK and when to use each


Overview
The Claude Agent SDK supports two distinct input modes for interacting with agents:
Streaming Input Mode (Default & Recommended) - A persistent, interactive session
Single Message Input - One-shot queries that use session state and resuming
This guide explains the differences, benefits, and use cases for each mode to help you choose the right approach for your application.

Streaming Input Mode (Recommended)
Streaming input mode is the preferred way to use the Claude Agent SDK. It provides full access to the agent’s capabilities and enables rich, interactive experiences.
It allows the agent to operate as a long lived process that takes in user input, handles interruptions, surfaces permission requests, and handles session management.

How It Works

Benefits
Image Uploads
Attach images directly to messages for visual analysis and understanding
Queued Messages
Send multiple messages that process sequentially, with ability to interrupt
Tool Integration
Full access to all tools and custom MCP servers during the session
Real-time Feedback
See responses as they’re generated, not just final results
Context Persistence
Maintain conversation context across multiple turns naturally

Implementation Example
```python
import { query, type SDKUserMessage } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";
import { readFile } from "fs/promises";
```

async function* generateMessages(): AsyncGenerator<SDKUserMessage> {
  // First message
  yield {
```python
    type: "user",
    message: {
      role: "user",
      content: "Analyze this codebase for security issues"
    },
    parent_tool_use_id: null
```
  };

  // Wait for conditions or user input
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));

  // Follow-up with image
  yield {
```python
    type: "user",
    message: {
      role: "user",
      content: [
        {
          type: "text",
          text: "Review this architecture diagram"
        },
        {
          type: "image",
          source: {
            type: "base64",
            media_type: "image/png",
            data: await readFile("diagram.png", "base64")
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    parent_tool_use_id: null
```
  };
}

// Process streaming responses
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: generateMessages(),
  options: {
    maxTurns: 10,
    allowedTools: ["Read", "Grep"]
  }
})) {
  if (message.type === "result" && message.subtype === "success") {
    console.log(message.result);
  }
}

In the TypeScript SDK, if your message generator throws, for example when a file it reads is missing, the stream ends with an error that reads Claude Code process aborted by user instead of the original error, so check the code inside your generator first when you see that message. The error may also be preceded by a long minified line of bundled SDK source, so read to the end of the output for the error text.
In the Python SDK, a generator exception is logged at debug level and the session stalls without raising, so if a streaming session hangs with no output, enable debug logging and check your generator.

Single Message Input
Single message input is simpler but more limited.

When to Use Single Message Input
Use single message input when:
You need a one-shot response
You do not need image attachments or mid-session control methods
You need to operate in a stateless environment, such as a lambda function

Limitations
Single message input mode does not support:
Direct image attachments in messages
Dynamic message queueing
Real-time interruption
Natural multi-turn conversations
If a query ends with an error result, such as error_max_turns, a single message query() call raises an error that includes the failure text after yielding the final result message, so wrap the loop in a try block if your code needs to continue. See Handle the result for the result subtypes.

Implementation Example
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

// Simple one-shot query
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Explain the authentication flow",
  options: {
    maxTurns: 1,
    allowedTools: ["Read", "Grep"]
  }
})) {
  if (message.type === "result" && message.subtype === "success") {
    console.log(message.result);
  }
}

// Continue conversation with session management
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Now explain the authorization process",
  options: {
    continue: true,
    maxTurns: 1
  }
})) {
  if (message.type === "result" && message.subtype === "success") {
    console.log(message.result);
  }
}
