Building images

Writing a Dockerfile
Writing a Dockerfile

Explanation

A Dockerfile is a text-based document that's used to create a container image. It provides instructions to the image builder on the commands to run, files to copy, startup command, and more.

As an example, the following Dockerfile would produce a ready-to-run Python application:

FROM python:3.13

WORKDIR /usr/local/app

# Install the application dependencies

COPY requirements.txt ./

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy in the source code

COPY src ./src

EXPOSE 8080

# Setup an app user so the container doesn't run as the root user

RUN useradd app

USER app

CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
Common instructions

Some of the most common instructions in a Dockerfile include:

FROM <image> - this specifies the base image that the build will extend.
WORKDIR <path> - this instruction specifies the "working directory" or the path in the image where files will be copied and commands will be executed.
COPY <host-path> <image-path> - this instruction tells the builder to copy files from the host and put them into the container image.
RUN <command> - this instruction tells the builder to run the specified command.
ENV <name> <value> - this instruction sets an environment variable that a running container will use.
EXPOSE <port-number> - this instruction sets configuration on the image that indicates a port the image would like to expose.
USER <user-or-uid> - this instruction sets the default user for all subsequent instructions.
CMD ["<command>", "<arg1>"] - this instruction sets the default command a container using this image will run.

To read through all of the instructions or go into greater detail, check out the Dockerfile reference.

Try it out

Just as you saw with the previous example, a Dockerfile typically follows these steps:

Determine your base image
Install application dependencies
Copy in any relevant source code and/or binaries
Configure the final image

In this quick hands-on guide, you'll write a Dockerfile that builds a simple Node.js application. If you're not familiar with JavaScript-based applications, don't worry. It isn't necessary for following along with this guide.

Set up

Download this ZIP file and extract the contents into a directory on your machine.

If you'd rather not download a ZIP file, clone the https://github.com/docker/getting-started-todo-app project and checkout the build-image-from-scratch branch.

Creating the Dockerfile

Now that you have the project, you’re ready to create the Dockerfile.

Download and install Docker Desktop.

Examine the project.

Explore the contents of getting-started-todo-app/app/. You'll notice that a Dockerfile already exists. It is a simple text file that you can open in any text or code editor.

Delete the existing Dockerfile.

For this exercise, you'll pretend you're starting from scratch and will create a new Dockerfile.

Create a file named Dockerfile in the getting-started-todo-app/app/ folder.

Dockerfile file extensions

It's important to note that the Dockerfile has no file extension. Some editors will automatically add an extension to the file (or complain it doesn't have one).

In the Dockerfile, define your base image by adding the following line:

FROM node:22-alpine

Now, define the working directory by using the WORKDIR instruction. This will specify where future commands will run and the directory files will be copied inside the container image.

WORKDIR /app

Copy all of the files from your project on your machine into the container image by using the COPY instruction:

COPY . .

Install the app's dependencies by using the yarn CLI and package manager. To do so, run a command using the RUN instruction:

RUN yarn install --production

Finally, specify the default command to run by using the CMD instruction:

CMD ["node", "./src/index.js"]

And with that, you should have the following Dockerfile:

FROM node:22-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN yarn install --production

CMD ["node", "./src/index.js"]

This Dockerfile isn't production-ready yet

It's important to note that this Dockerfile is not following all of the best practices yet (by design). It will build the app, but the builds won't be as fast, or the images as secure, as they could be.

Keep reading to learn more about how to make the image maximize the build cache, run as a non-root user, and multi-stage builds.

Building images

Build, tag, and publish an image
Build, tag, and publish an image

Explanation

In this guide, you will learn the following:

Building images - the process of building an image based on a Dockerfile
Tagging images - the process of giving an image a name, which also determines where the image can be distributed
Publishing images - the process to distribute or share the newly created image using a container registry
Building images

Most often, images are built using a Dockerfile. The most basic docker build command might look like the following:

docker build .

The final . in the command provides the path or URL to the build context. At this location, the builder will find the Dockerfile and other referenced files.

When you run a build, the builder pulls the base image, if needed, and then runs the instructions specified in the Dockerfile.

With the previous command, the image will have no name, but the output will provide the ID of the image. As an example, the previous command might produce the following output:

$ docker build .

With the previous output, you could start a container by using the referenced image:

That name certainly isn't memorable, which is where tagging becomes useful.

Tagging images

Tagging images is the method to provide an image with a memorable name. However, there is a structure to the name of an image. A full image name has the following structure:

[HOST[:PORT_NUMBER]/]PATH[:TAG]
HOST: The optional registry hostname where the image is located. If no host is specified, Docker's public registry at docker.io is used by default.
PORT_NUMBER: The registry port number if a hostname is provided
PATH: The path of the image, consisting of slash-separated components. For Docker Hub, the format follows [NAMESPACE/]REPOSITORY, where namespace is either a user's or organization's name. If no namespace is specified, library is used, which is the namespace for Docker Official Images.
TAG: A custom, human-readable identifier that's typically used to identify different versions or variants of an image. If no tag is specified, latest is used by default.

Some examples of image names include:

nginx, equivalent to docker.io/library/nginx:latest: this pulls an image from the docker.io registry, the library namespace, the nginx image repository, and the latest tag.
docker/welcome-to-docker, equivalent to docker.io/docker/welcome-to-docker:latest: this pulls an image from the docker.io registry, the docker namespace, the welcome-to-docker image repository, and the latest tag
ghcr.io/dockersamples/example-voting-app-vote:pr-311: this pulls an image from the GitHub Container Registry, the dockersamples namespace, the example-voting-app-vote image repository, and the pr-311 tag

To tag an image during a build, add the -t or --tag flag:

docker build -t my-username/my-image .

If you've already built an image, you can add another tag to the image by using the docker image tag command:

docker image tag my-username/my-image another-username/another-image:v1

Publishing images

Once you have an image built and tagged, you're ready to push it to a registry. To do so, use the docker push command:

docker push my-username/my-image

Within a few seconds, all of the layers for your image will be pushed to the registry.

Requiring authentication

Before you're able to push an image to a repository, you will need to be authenticated. To do so, simply use the docker login command.

Try it out

In this hands-on guide, you will build a simple image using a provided Dockerfile and push it to Docker Hub.

Set up

Get the sample application.

If you have Git, you can clone the repository for the sample application. Otherwise, you can download the sample application. Choose one of the following options.

Clone with git Download

Use the following command in a terminal to clone the sample application repository.

$ git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started-todo-app

Download and install Docker Desktop.

If you don't have a Docker account yet, create one now. Once you've done that, sign in to Docker Desktop using that account.

Build an image

Now that you have a repository on Docker Hub, it's time for you to build an image and push it to the repository.

Using a terminal in the root of the sample app repository, run the following command. Replace YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME with your Docker Hub username:

$ docker build -t YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME/concepts-build-image-demo .

As an example, if your username is mobywhale, you would run the command:

$ docker build -t mobywhale/concepts-build-image-demo .

Once the build has completed, you can view the image by using the following command:

$ docker image ls

The command will produce output similar to the following:

REPOSITORY                             TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE

mobywhale/concepts-build-image-demo    latest    746c7e06537f   24 seconds ago   354MB

You can actually view the history (or how the image was created) by using the docker image history command:

$ docker image history mobywhale/concepts-build-image-demo

You'll then see output similar to the following:

IMAGE          CREATED         CREATED BY                                      SIZE      COMMENT

This output shows the layers of the image, highlighting the layers you added and those that were inherited from your base image.

Push the image

Now that you have an image built, it's time to push the image to a registry.

Push the image using the docker push command:

$ docker push YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME/concepts-build-image-demo

If you receive a requested access to the resource is denied, make sure you are both logged in and that your Docker username is correct in the image tag.

After a moment, your image should be pushed to Docker Hub.
