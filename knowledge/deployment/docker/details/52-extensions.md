## Extension metadata

# Extension metadata

## The metadata.json file

The `metadata.json` file is the entry point for your extension. It contains the metadata for your extension, such as the
name, version, and description. It also contains the information needed to build and run your extension. The image for
a Docker extension must include a `metadata.json` file at the root of its filesystem.

The format of the `metadata.json` file must be:

```json
{
    "icon": "extension-icon.svg",
    "ui": ...
    "vm": ...
    "host": ...
}
```

The `ui`, `vm`, and `host` sections are optional and depend on what a given extension provides. They describe the extension content to be installed.

### UI section

The `ui` section defines a new tab that's added to the dashboard in Docker Desktop. It follows the form:

```json
"ui":{
    "dashboard-tab":
    {
        "title":"MyTitle",
        "root":"/ui",
        "src":"index.html"
    }
}
```

`root` specifies the folder where the UI code is within the extension image filesystem.
`src` specifies the entrypoint that should be loaded in the extension tab.

Other UI extension points will be available in the future.

### VM section

The `vm` section defines a backend service that runs inside the Desktop VM. It must define either an `image` or a
`compose.yaml` file that specifies what service to run in the Desktop VM.

```json
"vm": {
    "image":"${DESKTOP_PLUGIN_IMAGE}"
},
```

When you use `image`, a default compose file is generated for the extension.

> `${DESKTOP_PLUGIN_IMAGE}` is a specific keyword that allows an easy way to refer to the image packaging the extension.
> It is also possible to specify any other full image name here. However, in many cases using the same image makes
> things easier for extension development.

```json
"vm": {
    "composefile": "compose.yaml"
},
```

The Compose file, with a volume definition for example, would look like:

```yaml
services:
  myExtension:
    image: ${DESKTOP_PLUGIN_IMAGE}
    volumes:
      - /host/path:/container/path
```

### Host section

The `host` section defines executables that Docker Desktop copies on the host.

```json
  "host": {
    "binaries": [
      {
        "darwin": [
          {
            "path": "/darwin/myBinary"
          },
        ],
        "windows": [
          {
            "path": "/windows/myBinary.exe"
          },
        ],
        "linux": [
          {
            "path": "/linux/myBinary"
          },
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

`binaries` defines a list of binaries Docker Desktop copies from the extension image to the host.

`path` specifies the binary path in the image filesystem. Docker Desktop is responsible for copying these files in its own location, and the JavaScript API allows invokes these binaries.

## Extension security

# Extension security

## Extension capabilities

An extension can have the following optional parts: 
* A user interface in HTML or JavaScript, displayed in Docker Desktop Dashboard
* A backend part that runs as a container
* Executables deployed on the host machine.

Extensions are executed with the same permissions as the Docker Desktop user. Extension capabilities include running any Docker commands (including running containers and mounting folders), running extension binaries, and accessing files on your machine that are accessible by the user running Docker Desktop.
Note that extensions are not restricted to execute binaries that they list in the [host section](/extensions/extensions-sdk/architecture/metadata/#host-section) of the extension metadata: since these binaries can contain any code running as user, they can in turn execute any other commands as long as the user has rights to execute them.

The Extensions SDK provides a set of JavaScript APIs to invoke commands or invoke these binaries from the extension UI code. Extensions can also provide a backend part that starts a long-lived running container in the background.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Make sure you trust the publisher or author of the extension when you install it, as the extension has the same access rights as the user running Docker Desktop.

## Add a backend to your extension

# Add a backend to your extension

Your extension can ship a backend part with which the frontend can interact with. This page provides information on why and how to add a backend.

Before you start, make sure you have installed the latest version of [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

> Tip
>
> Check the [Quickstart guide](/extensions/extensions-sdk/quickstart/) and `docker extension init <my-extension>`. They provide a better base for your extension as it's more up-to-date and related to your install of Docker Desktop.

## Why add a backend?

Thanks to the Docker Extensions SDK, most of the time you should be able to do what you need from the Docker CLI
directly from [the frontend](/extensions/extensions-sdk/build/backend-extension-tutorial/frontend-extension-tutorial/#use-the-extension-apis-client).

Nonetheless, there are some cases where you might need to add a backend to your extension. So far, extension
builders have used the backend to:
- Store data in a local database and serve them back with a REST API.
- Store the extension state, for example when a button starts a long-running process, so that if you navigate away from the extension user interface and comes back, the frontend can pick up where it left off.

For more information about extension backends, see [Architecture](/extensions/extensions-sdk/architecture/#the-backend).

## Add a backend to the extension

If you created your extension using the `docker extension init` command, you already have a backend setup. Otherwise, you have to first create a `vm` directory that contains the code and updates the Dockerfile to
containerize it.

Here is the extension folder structure with a backend:

```bash
.
鈹溾攢鈹€ Dockerfile # (1)
鈹溾攢鈹€ Makefile
鈹溾攢鈹€ metadata.json
鈹溾攢鈹€ ui
    鈹斺攢鈹€ index.html
鈹斺攢鈹€ vm # (2)
    鈹溾攢鈹€ go.mod
    鈹斺攢鈹€ main.go
```

1. Contains everything required to build the backend and copy it in the extension's container filesystem.
2. The source folder that contains the backend code of the extension.

Although you can start from an empty directory or from the `vm-ui extension` [sample](https://github.com/docker/extensions-sdk/tree/main/samples),
it is highly recommended that you start from the `docker extension init` command and change it to suit your needs.

> [!TIP]
>
> The `docker extension init` generates a Go backend. But you can still use it as a starting point for
> your own extension and use any other language like Node.js, Python, Java, .Net, or any other language and framework.

In this tutorial, the backend service simply exposes one route that returns a JSON payload that says "Hello".

```json
{ "Message": "Hello" }
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> We recommend that, the frontend and the backend communicate through sockets, and named pipes on Windows, instead of
> HTTP. This prevents port collision with any other running application or container running
> on the host. Also, some Docker Desktop users are running in constrained environments where they
> can't open ports on their machines. When choosing the language and framework for your backend, make sure it
> supports sockets connection.

**Go**

```go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"log"
	"net"
	"net/http"
	"os"

	"github.com/labstack/echo"
	"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
	var socketPath string
	flag.StringVar(&socketPath, "socket", "/run/guest/volumes-service.sock", "Unix domain socket to listen on")
	flag.Parse()

	os.RemoveAll(socketPath)

	logrus.New().Infof("Starting listening on %s\n", socketPath)
	router := echo.New()
	router.HideBanner = true

	startURL := ""

	ln, err := listen(socketPath)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	router.Listener = ln

	router.GET("/hello", hello)

	log.Fatal(router.Start(startURL))
}

func listen(path string) (net.Listener, error) {
	return net.Listen("unix", path)
}

func hello(ctx echo.Context) error {
	return ctx.JSON(http.StatusOK, HTTPMessageBody{Message: "hello world"})
}

type HTTPMessageBody struct {
	Message string
}
```

> and let us know if you'd like a sample for .NET.

## Adapt the Dockerfile

> [!NOTE]
>
> When using the `docker extension init`, it creates a `Dockerfile` that already contains what is needed for a Go backend.

**Go**

To deploy your Go backend when installing the extension, you need first to configure the `Dockerfile`, so that it:
- Builds the backend application
- Copies the binary in the extension's container filesystem
- Starts the binary when the container starts listening on the extension socket

> [!TIP]
> 
> To ease version management, you can reuse the same image to build the frontend, build the
backend service, and package the extension.

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM node:17.7-alpine3.14 AS client-builder
# ... build frontend application

# Build the Go backend
FROM golang:1.17-alpine AS builder
ENV CGO_ENABLED=0
WORKDIR /backend
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-build \
    --mount=type=bind,source=vm/.,target=. \
    go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/service

FROM alpine:3.15
# ... add labels and copy the frontend application

COPY --from=builder /backend/bin/service /
CMD /service -socket /run/guest-services/extension-allthethings-extension.sock
```

## Configure the metadata file

To start the backend service of your extension inside the VM of Docker Desktop, you have to configure the image name
in the `vm` section of the `metadata.json` file.

```json
{
  "vm": {
    "image": "${DESKTOP_PLUGIN_IMAGE}"
  },
  "icon": "docker.svg",
  "ui": {
    ...
  }
}
```

For more information on the `vm` section of the `metadata.json`, see [Metadata](/extensions/extensions-sdk/architecture/metadata/).

> [!WARNING]
>
> Do not replace the `${DESKTOP_PLUGIN_IMAGE}` placeholder in the `metadata.json` file. The placeholder is replaced automatically with the correct image name when the extension is installed.

## Invoke the extension backend from your frontend

Using the [advanced frontend extension example](/extensions/extensions-sdk/build/backend-extension-tutorial/frontend-extension-tutorial/), we can invoke our extension backend.

Use the Docker Desktop Client object and then invoke the `/hello` route from the backend service with `ddClient.
extension.vm.service.get` that returns the body of the response.

**React**

Replace the `ui/src/App.tsx` file with the following code:

```tsx

// ui/src/App.tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { createDockerDesktopClient } from "@docker/extension-api-client";

//obtain docker desktop extension client
const ddClient = createDockerDesktopClient();

export function App() {
  const [hello, setHello] = useState<string>();

  useEffect(() => {
    const getHello = async () => {
      const result = await ddClient.extension.vm?.service?.get('/hello');
      setHello(JSON.stringify(result));
    }
    getHello()
  }, []);

  return (
    <Typography>{hello}</Typography>
  );
}

```

**Vue**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> We don't have an example for Vue yet. [Fill out the form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxJDGFJl5oJ06rG7uqtw1rsSBZpUhv_s9HHtw80cytkh2X-Q/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1333218187=Vue)
> and let us know if you'd like a sample with Vue.

> and let us know if you'd like a sample with Angular.

**Svelte**

> and let us know if you'd like a sample with Svelte.

## Re-build the extension and update it

Since you have modified the configuration of the extension and added a stage in the Dockerfile, you must re-build the extension.

```bash
docker build --tag=awesome-inc/my-extension:latest .
```

Once built, you need to update it, or install it if you haven't already done so.

```bash
docker extension update awesome-inc/my-extension:latest
```

Now you can see the backend service running in the **Containers** view of the Docker Desktop Dashboard and watch the logs when you need to debug it.

> [!TIP]
>
> You may need to turn on the **Show system containers** option in **Settings** to see the backend container running.
> See [Show extension containers](/extensions/extensions-sdk/dev/test-debug/#show-the-extension-containers) for more information.

Open the Docker Desktop Dashboard and select the **Containers** tab. You should see the response from the backend service
call displayed.

## Create an advanced frontend extension

# Create an advanced frontend extension

To start creating your extension, you first need a directory with files which range from the extension鈥檚 source code to the required extension-specific files. This page provides information on how to set up an extension with a more advanced frontend.

Before you start, make sure you have installed the latest version of [Docker Desktop](/desktop/release-notes/).

## Extension folder structure

The quickest way to create a new extension is to run `docker extension init my-extension` as in the
[Quickstart](/extensions/extensions-sdk/quickstart/). This creates a new directory `my-extension` that contains a fully functional extension.

> [!TIP]
>
> The `docker extension init` generates a React based extension. But you can still use it as a starting point for
> your own extension and use any other frontend framework, like Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc. or even stay with
> vanilla Javascript.

Although you can start from an empty directory or from the `react-extension` [sample folder](https://github.com/docker/extensions-sdk/tree/main/samples),
it's highly recommended that you start from the `docker extension init` command and change it to suit your needs.

```bash
.
鈹溾攢鈹€ Dockerfile # (1)
鈹溾攢鈹€ ui # (2)
鈹�   鈹溾攢鈹€ public # (3)
鈹�   鈹�   鈹斺攢鈹€ index.html
鈹�   鈹溾攢鈹€ src # (4)

鈹�   鈹溾攢鈹€ tsconfig.json
鈹溾攢鈹€ docker.svg # (5)
鈹斺攢鈹€ metadata.json # (6)
```

1. Contains everything required to build the extension and run it in Docker Desktop.
2. High-level folder containing your front-end app source code.
3. Assets that aren鈥檛 compiled or dynamically generated are stored here. These can be static assets like logos or the robots.txt file.
4. The src, or source folder contains all the React components, external CSS files, and dynamic assets that are brought into the component files.
5. The icon that is displayed in the left-menu of the Docker Desktop Dashboard.
6. A file that provides information about the extension such as the name, description, and version.

## Adapting the Dockerfile

> [!NOTE]
>
> When using the `docker extension init`, it creates a `Dockerfile` that already contains what is needed for a React
> extension.

Once the extension is created, you need to configure the `Dockerfile` to build the extension and configure the labels
that are used to populate the extension's card in the Marketplace. Here is an example of a `Dockerfile` for a React
extension:

**React**

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM node:18.9-alpine3.15 AS client-builder
WORKDIR /ui
# cache packages in layer
COPY ui/package.json /ui/package.json
COPY ui/package-lock.json /ui/package-lock.json
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/usr/src/app/.npm \
    npm set cache /usr/src/app/.npm && \
    npm ci
# install
COPY ui /ui
RUN npm run build

FROM alpine
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="My extension" \
    org.opencontainers.image.description="Your Desktop Extension Description" \
    org.opencontainers.image.vendor="Awesome Inc." \
    com.docker.desktop.extension.api.version="0.3.3" \
    com.docker.desktop.extension.icon="https://www.docker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moby-logo.png" \
    com.docker.extension.screenshots="" \
    com.docker.extension.detailed-description="" \
    com.docker.extension.publisher-url="" \
    com.docker.extension.additional-urls="" \
    com.docker.extension.changelog=""

COPY metadata.json .
COPY docker.svg .
COPY --from=client-builder /ui/build ui

```
> Note
>
> In the example Dockerfile, you can see that the image label `com.docker.desktop.extension.icon` is set to an icon URL. The Extensions Marketplace displays this icon without installing the extension. The Dockerfile also includes `COPY docker.svg .` to copy an icon file inside the image. This second icon file is used to display the extension UI in the Dashboard, once the extension is installed.

> and let us know if you'd like a Dockerfile for Svelte.

## Configure the metadata file

In order to add a tab in Docker Desktop for your extension, you have to configure it in the `metadata.json`
file the root of your extension directory.

```json
{
  "icon": "docker.svg",
  "ui": {
    "dashboard-tab": {
      "title": "UI Extension",
      "root": "/ui",
      "src": "index.html"
    }
  }
}
```

The `title` property is the name of the extension that is displayed in the left-menu of the Docker Desktop Dashboard.
The `root` property is the path to the frontend application in the extension's container filesystem used by the
system to deploy it on the host.
The `src` property is the path to the HTML entry point of the frontend application within the `root` folder.

For more information on the `ui` section of the `metadata.json`, see [Metadata](/extensions/extensions-sdk/architecture/metadata/#ui-section).

## Build the extension and install it

Now that you have configured the extension, you need to build the extension image that Docker Desktop will use to
install it.

```bash
docker build --tag=awesome-inc/my-extension:latest .
```

This built an image tagged `awesome-inc/my-extension:latest`, you can run `docker inspect
awesome-inc/my-extension:latest` to see more details about it.

Finally, you can install the extension and see it appearing in the Docker Desktop Dashboard.

```bash
docker extension install awesome-inc/my-extension:latest
```

## Use the Extension APIs client

To use the Extension APIs and perform actions with Docker Desktop, the extension must first import the
`@docker/extension-api-client` library. To install it, run the command below:

```bash
npm install @docker/extension-api-client
```

Then call the `createDockerDesktopClient` function to create a client object to call the extension APIs.

```js
import { createDockerDesktopClient } from '@docker/extension-api-client';

const ddClient = createDockerDesktopClient();
```

When using Typescript, you can also install `@docker/extension-api-client-types` as a dev dependency. This will
provide you with type definitions for the extension APIs and auto-completion in your IDE.

```bash
npm install @docker/extension-api-client-types --save-dev
```

![Auto completion in an IDE](/extensions/extensions-sdk/build/frontend-extension-tutorial/images/types-autocomplete.png)

For example, you can use the `docker.cli.exec` function to get the list of all the containers via the `docker ps --all`
command and display the result in a table.

**React**

Replace the `ui/src/App.tsx` file with the following code:

```tsx

// ui/src/App.tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import {
  Paper,
  Stack,
  Table,
  TableBody,
  TableCell,
  TableContainer,
  TableHead,
  TableRow,
  Typography
} from "@mui/material";
import { createDockerDesktopClient } from "@docker/extension-api-client";

//obtain docker desktop extension client
const ddClient = createDockerDesktopClient();

export function App() {
  const [containers, setContainers] = React.useState<any[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // List all containers
    ddClient.docker.cli.exec('ps', ['--all', '--format', '"{{json .}}"']).then((result) => {
      // result.parseJsonLines() parses the output of the command into an array of objects
      setContainers(result.parseJsonLines());
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <Stack>
      <Typography data-testid="heading" variant="h3" role="title">
        Container list
      </Typography>
      <Typography
      data-testid="subheading"
      variant="body1"
      color="text.secondary"
      sx={{ mt: 2 }}
    >
      Simple list of containers using Docker Extensions SDK.
      </Typography>
      <TableContainer sx={{mt:2}}>
        <Table>
          <TableHead>
            <TableRow>
              <TableCell>Container id</TableCell>
              <TableCell>Image</TableCell>
              <TableCell>Command</TableCell>
              <TableCell>Created</TableCell>
              <TableCell>Status</TableCell>
            </TableRow>

## Policies enforced for the front-end code

Extension UI code is rendered in a separate electron session and doesn't have a node.js environment initialized, nor direct access to the electron APIs. 

This is to limit the possible unexpected side effects to the overall Docker Dashboard.

The extension UI code can't perform privileged tasks, such as making changes to the system, or spawning sub-processes, except by using the SDK APIs provided with the extension framework.
The Extension UI code can also perform interactions with Docker Desktop, such as navigating to various places in the Dashboard, only through the extension SDK APIs.

Extensions UI parts are isolated from each other and extension UI code is running in its own session for each extension. Extensions can't access other extensions鈥� session data.

`localStorage` is one of the mechanisms of a browser鈥檚 web storage. It allows users to save data as key-value pairs in the browser for later use. `localStorage` doesn't clear data when the browser (the extension pane) closes. This makes it ideal for persisting data when navigating out of the extension to other parts of Docker Desktop.

If your extension uses `localStorage` to store data, other extensions running in Docker Desktop can't access the local storage of your extension. The extension鈥檚 local storage is persisted even after Docker Desktop is stopped or restarted. When an extension is upgraded, its local storage is persisted, whereas when it is uninstalled, its local storage is completely removed.

## Re-build the extension and update it

Since you have modified the code of the extension, you must build again the extension.

```console
$ docker build --tag=awesome-inc/my-extension:latest .
```

Once built, you need to update it.

```console
$ docker extension update awesome-inc/my-extension:latest
```

Now you can see the backend service running in the containers tab of the Docker Desktop Dashboard and watch the logs
when you need to debug it.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can turn on [hot reloading](/extensions/extensions-sdk/dev/test-debug/#hot-reloading-whilst-developing-the-ui) to avoid the need to
> rebuild the extension every time you make a change.

## Create a simple extension

# Create a simple extension

To start creating your extension, you first need a directory with files which range from the extension鈥檚 source code to the required extension-specific files. This page provides information on how to set up a minimal frontend extension based on plain HTML.

Before you start, make sure you have installed the latest version of [Docker Desktop](/desktop/release-notes/).

> Tip
>
> If you want to start a codebase for your new extension, our [Quickstart guide](/extensions/extensions-sdk/quickstart/) and `docker extension init <my-extension>` provides a better base for your extension.

## Extension folder structure

In the `minimal-frontend` [sample folder](https://github.com/docker/extensions-sdk/tree/main/samples), you can find a ready-to-go example that represents a UI Extension built on HTML. We will go through this code example in this tutorial.

Although you can start from an empty directory, it is highly recommended that you start from the template below and change it accordingly to suit your needs.

```bash
.
鈹溾攢鈹€ Dockerfile # (1)
鈹溾攢鈹€ metadata.json # (2)
鈹斺攢鈹€ ui # (3)
    鈹斺攢鈹€ index.html
```

1. Contains everything required to build the extension and run it in Docker Desktop.
2. A file that provides information about the extension such as the name, description, and version.
3. The source folder that contains all your HTML, CSS and JS files. There can also be other static assets such as logos
   and icons. For more information and guidelines on building the UI, see the [Design and UI styling section](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/design-guidelines/).

## Create a Dockerfile

At a minimum, your Dockerfile needs:

- [Labels](/extensions/extensions-sdk/extensions/labels/) which provide extra information about the extension, icon and screenshots.
- The source code which in this case is an `index.html` that sits within the `ui` folder.
- The `metadata.json` file.

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM scratch

LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="Minimal frontend" \
    org.opencontainers.image.description="A sample extension to show how easy it's to get started with Desktop Extensions." \
    org.opencontainers.image.vendor="Awesome Inc." \
    com.docker.desktop.extension.api.version="0.3.3" \
    com.docker.desktop.extension.icon="https://www.docker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moby-logo.png"

COPY ui ./ui
COPY metadata.json .
```

## Configure the metadata file

A `metadata.json` file is required at the root of the image filesystem.

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "dashboard-tab": {
      "title": "Minimal frontend",
      "root": "/ui",
      "src": "index.html"
    }
  }
}
```

For more information on the `metadata.json`, see [Metadata](/extensions/extensions-sdk/architecture/metadata/).

## Build the extension and install it

Now that you have configured the extension, you need to build the extension image that Docker Desktop will use to
install it.

```console
$ docker build --tag=awesome-inc/my-extension:latest .
```

This built an image tagged `awesome-inc/my-extension:latest`, you can run `docker inspect awesome-inc/my-extension:latest` to see more details about it.

Finally, you can install the extension and see it appearing in the Docker Desktop Dashboard.

```console
$ docker extension install awesome-inc/my-extension:latest
```

## Preview the extension

To preview the extension in Docker Desktop, close and open the Docker Desktop Dashboard once the installation is complete.

The left-hand menu displays a new tab with the name of your extension.

## Design guidelines for Docker extensions

# Design guidelines for Docker extensions

At Docker, we aim to build tools that integrate into a user's existing workflows rather than requiring them to adopt new ones. We strongly recommend that you follow these guidelines when creating extensions. We review and approve your Marketplace publication based on these requirements.

Here is a simple checklist to go through when creating your extension:
- Is it easy to get started?
- Is it easy to use?
- Is it easy to get help when needed?

## Create a consistent experience with Docker Desktop

Use the [Docker Material UI Theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@docker/docker-mui-theme) and the [Docker Extensions Styleguide](https://www.figma.com/file/U7pLWfEf6IQKUHLhdateBI/Docker-Design-Guidelines?node-id=1%3A28771) to ensure that your extension feels like it is part of Docker Desktop to create a seamless experience for users.

- Ensure the extension has both a light and dark theme. Using the components and styles as per the Docker style guide ensures that your extension meets the [level AA accessibility standard.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance).

  ![Light and dark mode](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/design-guidelines/images/light_dark_mode.webp)

- Ensure that your extension icon is visible both in light and dark mode.

  ![Icon colors in light and dark mode](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/design-guidelines/images/icon_colors.webp)

- Ensure that the navigational behavior is consistent with the rest of Docker Desktop. Add a header to set the context for the extension.

  ![Header that sets the context](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/design-guidelines/images/header.webp)

- Avoid embedding terminal windows. The advantage we have with Docker Desktop over the CLI is that we have the opportunity to provide rich information to users. Make use of this interface as much as possible. 

  ![Terminal window used incorrectly](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/design-guidelines/images/terminal_window_dont.webp)

  ![Terminal window used correctly](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/design-guidelines/images/terminal_window_do.webp)

## Build features natively

- In order not to disrupt the flow of users, avoid scenarios where the user has to navigate outside Docker Desktop, to the CLI or a webpage for example, in order to carry out certain functionalities. Instead, build features that are native to Docker Desktop.

  ![Incorrect way to switch context](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/design-guidelines/images/switch_context_dont.webp)

  ![Correct way to switch context](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/design-guidelines/images/switch_context_do.webp)

## Break down complicated user flows

- If a flow is too complicated or the concept is abstract, break down the flow into multiple steps with one simple call-to-action in each step. This helps when onboarding novice users to your extension

  ![A complicated flow](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/design-guidelines/images/complicated_flows.webp)

- Where there are multiple call-to-actions, ensure you use the primary (filled button style) and secondary buttons (outline button style) to convey the importance of each action.

  ![Call to action](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/design-guidelines/images/cta.webp)

## Onboarding new users

When creating your extension, ensure that first time users of the extension and your product can understand its value-add and adopt it easily. Ensure you include contextual help within the extension.

- Ensure that all necessary information is added to the extensions Marketplace as well as the extensions detail page. This should include:
  - Screenshots of the extension. Note that the recommended size for screenshots is 2400x1600 pixels. 
  - A detailed description that covers what the purpose of the extension is, who would find it useful and how it works.
  - Link to necessary resources such as documentation.
- If your extension has particularly complex functionality, add a demo or video to the start page. This helps onboard a first time user quickly.

## MUI best practices

# MUI best practices

This article assumes you're following our recommended practice by using our [Material UI theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@docker/docker-mui-theme).
Following the steps below maximizes compatibility with Docker Desktop and minimizes the work you need to do as an
extension author. They should be considered supplementary to the non-MUI-specific guidelines found in the
[UI Styling overview](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/mui-best-practices/).

## Assume the theme can change at any time

Resist the temptation to fine-tune your UI with precise colors, offsets and font sizings to make it look as attractive as possible. Any specializations you make today will be relative to the current MUI theme, and may look worse when the theme changes. Any part of the theme might change without warning, including (but not limited to):

-  The font, or font sizes
-  Border thicknesses or styles
-  Colors:
   -  Our palette members (e.g. `red-100`) could change their RGB values
   -  The semantic colors (e.g. `error`, `primary`, `textPrimary`, etc) could be changed to use a different member of our palette
   -  Background colors (e.g. those of the page, or of dialogs) could change
-  Spacings:
   -  The size of the basic unit of spacing,(exposed via `theme.spacing`. For instance, we may allow users to customize the density of the UI
   -  The default spacing between paragraphs or grid items

The best way to build your UI, so that it鈥檚 robust against future theming changes, is to:

-  Override the default styling as little as possible.
-  Use semantic typography. e.g. use `Typography`s or `Link`s with appropriate `variant`s instead of using typographical HTML elements (`<a>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, etc) directly.
-  Use canned sizes. e.g. use `size="small"` on buttons, or `fontSize="small"` on icons, instead of specifying sizes in pixels.
-  Prefer semantic colors. e.g. use `error` or `primary` over explicit color codes.
-  Write as little CSS as possible. Write semantic markup instead. For example, if you want to space out paragraphs of text, use the `paragraph` prop on your `Typography` instances. If you want to space out something else, use a `Stack` or `Grid` with the default spacing.
-  Use visual idioms you鈥檝e seen in the Docker Desktop UI, since these are the main ones we鈥檒l test any theme changes against.

## When you go custom, centralize it

Sometimes you鈥檒l need a piece of UI that doesn鈥檛 exist in our design system. If so, we recommend that you first reach out to us. We may already have something in our internal design system, or we may be able to expand our design system to accommodate your use case.

If you still decide to build it yourself after contacting us, try and define the new UI in a reusable fashion. If you define your custom UI in just one place, it鈥檒l make it easier to change in the future if our core theme changes. You could use:

-  A new `variant` of an existing component - see [MUI docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theme-components/#creating-new-component-variants)
-  A MUI mixin (a freeform bundle of reusable styling rules defined inside a theme)
-  A new [reusable component](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/how-to-customize/#2-reusable-component)

Some of the above options require you to extend our MUI theme. See the MUI documentation on [theme composition](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/#nesting-the-theme).

## Extension Backend

# Extension Backend

The `ddClient.extension.vm` object can be used to communicate with the backend defined in the [vm section](/extensions/extensions-sdk/architecture/metadata/#vm-section) of the extension metadata.

## get

鈻� **get**(`url`): `Promise`<`unknown`\>

Performs an HTTP GET request to a backend service.

```typescript
ddClient.extension.vm.service
 .get("/some/service")
 .then((value: any) => console.log(value)
```

See [Service API Reference](/reference/api/extensions-sdk/HttpService/) for other HTTP methods.

> Deprecated extension backend communication
>
> The methods below that use `window.ddClient.backend` are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the methods specified above.

The `window.ddClient.backend` object can be used to communicate with the backend
defined in the [vm section](/extensions/extensions-sdk/architecture/metadata/#vm-section) of the
extension metadata. The client is already connected to the backend.

Example usages:

```typescript
window.ddClient.backend
  .get("/some/service")
  .then((value: any) => console.log(value));

window.ddClient.backend
  .post("/some/service", { ... })
  .then((value: any) => console.log(value));

window.ddClient.backend
  .put("/some/service", { ... })
  .then((value: any) => console.log(value));

window.ddClient.backend
  .patch("/some/service", { ... })
  .then((value: any) => console.log(value));

window.ddClient.backend
  .delete("/some/service")
  .then((value: any) => console.log(value));

window.ddClient.backend
  .head("/some/service")
  .then((value: any) => console.log(value));

window.ddClient.backend
  .request({ url: "/url", method: "GET", headers: { 'header-key': 'header-value' }, data: { ... }})
  .then((value: any) => console.log(value));
```

## Run a command in the extension backend container

For example, execute the command `ls -l` inside the backend container:

```typescript
await ddClient.extension.vm.cli.exec("ls", ["-l"]);
```

Stream the output of the command executed in the backend container. For example, spawn the command `ls -l` inside the backend container:

```typescript
await ddClient.extension.vm.cli.exec("ls", ["-l"], {
  stream: {
    onOutput(data) {
      if (data.stdout) {
        console.error(data.stdout);
      } else {
        console.log(data.stderr);
      }
    },
    onError(error) {
      console.error(error);
    },
    onClose(exitCode) {
      console.log("onClose with exit code " + exitCode);
    },
  },
});
```

For more details, refer to the [Extension VM API Reference](/reference/api/extensions-sdk/ExtensionVM/)

> Deprecated extension backend command execution
>
> This method is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the specified method above.

If your extension ships with additional binaries that should be run inside the
backend container, you can use the `execInVMExtension` function:

```typescript
const output = await window.ddClient.backend.execInVMExtension(
  `cliShippedInTheVm xxx`
);
console.log(output);
```

## Invoke an extension binary on the host

Invoke a binary on the host. The binary is typically shipped with your extension using the [host section](/extensions/extensions-sdk/architecture/metadata/#host-section) in the extension metadata. Note that extensions run with user access rights, this API is not restricted to binaries listed in the [host section](/extensions/extensions-sdk/architecture/metadata/#host-section) of the extension metadata (some extensions might install software during user interaction, and invoke newly installed binaries even if not listed in the extension metadata).

For example, execute the shipped binary `kubectl -h` command in the host:

```typescript
await ddClient.extension.host.cli.exec("kubectl", ["-h"]);
```

As long as the `kubectl` binary is shipped as part of your extension, you can spawn the `kubectl -h` command in the host and get the output stream:

```typescript
await ddClient.extension.host.cli.exec("kubectl", ["-h"], {
  stream: {
    onOutput(data: { stdout: string } | { stderr: string }): void {
      if (data.stdout) {
        console.error(data.stdout);
      } else {
        console.log(data.stderr);
      }
    },
    onError(error: any): void {
      console.error(error);
    },
    onClose(exitCode: number): void {
      console.log("onClose with exit code " + exitCode);
    },
  },
});
```

You can stream the output of the command executed in the backend container or in the host.

For more details, refer to the [Extension Host API Reference](/reference/api/extensions-sdk/ExtensionHost/)

> Deprecated invocation of extension binary
>
> This method is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the method specified above.

To execute a command in the host:

```typescript
window.ddClient.execHostCmd(`cliShippedOnHost xxx`).then((cmdResult: any) => {
  console.log(cmdResult);
});
```

To stream the output of the command executed in the backend container or in the host:

```typescript
window.ddClient.spawnHostCmd(
  `cliShippedOnHost`,
  [`arg1`, `arg2`],
  (data: any, err: any) => {
    console.log(data.stdout, data.stderr);
    // Once the command exits we get the status code
    if (data.code) {
      console.log(data.code);
    }
  }
);
```

> [!NOTE]
> 
>You cannot use this to chain commands in a single `exec()` invocation (like `cmd1 $(cmd2)` or using pipe between commands).
>
> You need to invoke `exec()` for each command and parse results to pass parameters to the next command if needed.

---

## Navigation

# Navigation

`ddClient.desktopUI.navigate` enables navigation to specific screens of Docker Desktop such as the containers tab, the images tab, or a specific container's logs.

For example, navigate to a given container logs:

```typescript
const id = '8c7881e6a107';
try {
  await ddClient.desktopUI.navigate.viewContainerLogs(id);
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
  ddClient.desktopUI.toast.error(
    `Failed to navigate to logs for container "${id}".`
  );
}
```

#### Parameters

| Name | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :--- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

window.ddClient.openExternal("https://docker.com");
```

## Navigation to Dashboard routes

From your extension, you can also [navigate](/extensions/extensions-sdk/dev/api/dashboard/dashboard-routes-navigation/) to other parts of the Docker Desktop Dashboard.

# Docker

## Docker objects

鈻� **listContainers**(`options?`): `Promise`<`unknown`\>

To get the list of containers:

```typescript
const containers = await ddClient.docker.listContainers();
```

鈻� **listImages**(`options?`): `Promise`<`unknown`\>

To get the list of local container images:

```typescript
const images = await ddClient.docker.listImages();
```

See the [Docker API reference](/reference/api/extensions-sdk/Docker/) for details about these methods.

> Deprecated access to Docker objects
>
> The methods below are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the methods specified above.

```typescript
const containers = await window.ddClient.listContainers();

const images = await window.ddClient.listImages();
```

## Docker commands

Extensions can also directly execute the `docker` command line.

鈻� **exec**(`cmd`, `args`): `Promise`<[`ExecResult`](/reference/api/extensions-sdk/ExecResult/)\>

```typescript
const result = await ddClient.docker.cli.exec("info", [
  "--format",
  '"{{ json . }}"',
]);
```

The result contains both the standard output and the standard error of the executed command:

```json
{
  "stderr": "...",
  "stdout": "..."
}
```

In this example, the command output is JSON.
For convenience, the command result object also has methods to easily parse it:

- `result.lines(): string[]` splits output lines.
- `result.parseJsonObject(): any` parses a well-formed json output.
- `result.parseJsonLines(): any[]` parses each output line as a json object.

鈻� **exec**(`cmd`, `args`, `options`): `void`

The command above streams the output as a result of the execution of a Docker command.
This is useful if you need to get the output as a stream or the output of the command is too long.

```typescript
await ddClient.docker.cli.exec("logs", ["-f", "..."], {
  stream: {
    onOutput(data) {
      if (data.stdout) {
        console.error(data.stdout);
      } else {
        console.log(data.stderr);
      }
    },
    onError(error) {
      console.error(error);
    },
    onClose(exitCode) {
      console.log("onClose with exit code " + exitCode);
    },
    splitOutputLines: true,
  },
});
```

The child process created by the extension is killed (`SIGTERM`) automatically when you close the dashboard in Docker Desktop or when you exit the extension UI.
If needed, you can also use the result of the `exec(streamOptions)` call in order to kill (`SIGTERM`) the process.

```typescript
const logListener = await ddClient.docker.cli.exec("logs", ["-f", "..."], {
  stream: {
    // ...
  },
});

// when done listening to logs or before starting a new one, kill the process
logListener.close();
```

This `exec(streamOptions)` API can also be used to listen to docker events:

```typescript
await ddClient.docker.cli.exec(
  "events",
  ["--format", "{{ json . }}", "--filter", "container=my-container"],
  {
    stream: {
      onOutput(data) {
        if (data.stdout) {
          const event = JSON.parse(data.stdout);
          console.log(event);
        } else {
          console.log(data.stderr);
        }
      },
      onClose(exitCode) {
        console.log("onClose with exit code " + exitCode);
      },
      splitOutputLines: true,
    },
  }
);
```

> [!NOTE]
>
>You cannot use this to chain commands in a single `exec()` invocation (like `docker kill $(docker ps -q)` or using pipe between commands).
>
> You need to invoke `exec()` for each command and parse results to pass parameters to the next command if needed.

See the [Exec API reference](/reference/api/extensions-sdk/Exec/) for details about these methods.

> Deprecated execution of Docker commands
>
> This method is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the one specified just below.

```typescript
const output = await window.ddClient.execDockerCmd(
  "info",
  "--format",
  '"{{ json . }}"'
);

window.ddClient.spawnDockerCmd("logs", ["-f", "..."], (data, error) => {
  console.log(data.stdout);
});
```

## Extension UI API

# Extension UI API

The extensions UI runs in a sandboxed environment and doesn't have access to any
electron or nodejs APIs.

The extension UI API provides a way for the frontend to perform different actions
and communicate with the Docker Desktop dashboard or the underlying system.

JavaScript API libraries, with Typescript support, are available in order to get all the API definitions in to your extension code.

- [@docker/extension-api-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@docker/extension-api-client) gives access to the extension API entrypoint `DockerDesktopClient`.
- [@docker/extension-api-client-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@docker/extension-api-client-types) can be added as a dev dependency in order to get types auto-completion in your IDE.

```Typescript
import { createDockerDesktopClient } from '@docker/extension-api-client';

export function App() {
  // obtain Docker Desktop client
  const ddClient = createDockerDesktopClient();
  // use ddClient to perform extension actions
}
```

The `ddClient` object gives access to various APIs:

- [Extension Backend](/extensions/extensions-sdk/dev/api/overview/backend/)
- [Docker](/extensions/extensions-sdk/dev/api/overview/docker/)
- [Dashboard](/extensions/extensions-sdk/dev/api/overview/dashboard/)
- [Navigation](/extensions/extensions-sdk/dev/api/overview/dashboard-routes-navigation/)

See also the [Extensions API reference](/reference/api/extensions-sdk/).

## Continuous Integration (CI)

# Continuous Integration (CI)

In order to help validate your extension and ensure it's functional, the Extension SDK provides tools to help you setup continuous integration for your extension.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The [Docker Desktop Action](https://github.com/docker/desktop-action) and the [extension-test-helper library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@docker/extension-test-helper) are both [experimental](https://docs.docker.com/release-lifecycle/#experimental).

## Setup CI environment with GitHub Actions

You need Docker Desktop to be able to install and validate your extension.
You can start Docker Desktop in GitHub Actions using the [Docker Desktop Action](https://github.com/docker/desktop-action), by adding the following to a workflow file:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: start_desktop
    uses: docker/desktop-action/start@v0.1.0
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> This action supports only GitHub Actions macOS runners at the moment. You need to specify `runs-on: macOS-latest` for your end to end tests.

Once the step has executed, the next steps use Docker Desktop and the Docker CLI to install and test the extension.

## Validating your extension with Puppeteer

Once Docker Desktop starts in CI, you can build, install, and validate your extension with Jest and Puppeteer.

First, build and install the extension from your test:

```ts
import { DesktopUI } from "@docker/extension-test-helper";
import { exec as originalExec } from "child_process";
import * as util from "util";

export const exec = util.promisify(originalExec);

// keep a handle on the app to stop it at the end of tests
let dashboard: DesktopUI;

beforeAll(async () => {
  await exec(`docker build -t my/extension:latest .`, {
    cwd: "my-extension-src-root",
  });

  await exec(`docker extension install -f my/extension:latest`);
});
```

Then open the Docker Desktop Dashboard and run some tests in your extension's UI:

```ts
describe("Test my extension", () => {
  test("should be functional", async () => {
    dashboard = await DesktopUI.start();

    const eFrame = await dashboard.navigateToExtension("my/extension");

    // use puppeteer APIs to manipulate the UI, click on buttons, expect visual display and validate your extension
    await eFrame.waitForSelector("#someElementId");
  });
});
```

Finally, close the Docker Desktop Dashboard and uninstall your extension:

```ts
afterAll(async () => {
  dashboard?.stop();
  await exec(`docker extension uninstall my/extension`);
});
```

## Test and debug

# Test and debug

In order to improve the developer experience, Docker Desktop provides a set of tools to help you test and debug your extension.

### Open Chrome DevTools

In order to open the Chrome DevTools for your extension when you select the **Extensions** tab, run:

```console
$ docker extension dev debug <name-of-your-extensions>
```

Each subsequent click on the extension tab also opens Chrome DevTools. To stop this behaviour, run:

```console
$ docker extension dev reset <name-of-your-extensions>
```

After an extension is deployed, it is also possible to open Chrome DevTools from the UI extension part using a variation of the [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code). Select the **Extensions** tab, and then hit the key sequence `up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, p, d, t`.

### Hot reloading whilst developing the UI

During UI development, it鈥檚 helpful to use hot reloading to test your changes without rebuilding your entire
extension. To do this, you can configure Docker Desktop to load your UI from a development server, such as the one
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) starts when invoked with `npm start`.

Assuming your app runs on the default port, start your UI app and then run:

```console
$ cd ui
$ npm run dev
```

This starts a development server that listens on port 3000.

You can now tell Docker Desktop to use this as the frontend source. In another terminal run:

```console
$ docker extension dev ui-source <name-of-your-extensions> http://localhost:3000
```

Close and reopen the Docker Desktop dashboard and go to your extension. All the changes to the frontend code are immediately visible.

Once finished, you can reset the extension configuration to the original settings. This will also reset opening Chrome DevTools if you used `docker extension dev debug <name-of-your-extensions>`:

```console
$ docker extension dev reset <name-of-your-extensions>
```

## Show the extension containers

If your extension is composed of one or more services running as containers in the Docker Desktop VM, you can access them easily from the dashboard in Docker Desktop.

1. In Docker Desktop, navigate to **Settings**.
2. Under the **Extensions** tab, select the **Show Docker Desktop Extensions system containers** option. You can now view your extension containers and their logs.

## Clean up

To remove the extension, run:

```console
$ docker extension rm <name-of-your-extension>
```

## What's next

- `docker extension enable` turns on Docker extensions.
- `docker extension dev` commands for extension development.
- `docker extension disable` turns off Docker extensions.
- `docker extension init` creates a new Docker extension.
- `docker extension install` installs a Docker extension with the specified image.
- `docker extension ls` list installed Docker extensions.
- `docker extension rm` removes a Docker extension.
- `docker extension update` removes and re-installs a Docker extension.
- `docker extension validate` validates the extension metadata file against the JSON schema.

## Package and release your extension

# Package and release your extension

This page contains additional information on how to package and distribute extensions.

## Package your extension

Docker extensions are packaged as Docker images. The entire extension runtime including the UI, backend services (host or VM), and any necessary binary must be included in the extension image.
Every extension image must contain a `metadata.json` file at the root of its filesystem that defines the [contents of the extension](/extensions/extensions-sdk/architecture/metadata/).

The Docker image must have several [image labels](/extensions/extensions-sdk/extensions/DISTRIBUTION/labels/), providing information about the extension. See how to use [extension labels](/extensions/extensions-sdk/extensions/DISTRIBUTION/labels/) to provide extension overview information.

To package and release an extension, you must build a Docker image (`docker build`), and push the image to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) (`docker push`) with a specific tag that lets you manage versions of the extension.

## Release your extension

Docker image tags must follow semver conventions in order to allow fetching the latest version of the extension, and to know if there are updates available. See [semver.org](https://semver.org/) to learn more about semantic versioning.

Extension images must be multi-arch images so that users can install extensions on ARM/AMD hardware. These multi-arch images can include ARM/AMD specific binaries. Mac users will automatically use the right image based on their architecture.
Extensions that install binaries on the host must also provide Windows binaries in the same extension image. See how to [build a multi-arch image](/extensions/extensions-sdk/extensions/DISTRIBUTION/multi-arch/) for your extension.

You can implement extensions without any constraints on the code repository. Docker doesn't need access to the code repository in order to use the extension. Also, you can manage new releases of your extension, without any dependency on Docker Desktop releases.

## New releases and updates

You can release a new version of your Docker extension by pushing a new image with a new tag to Docker Hub.

Any new image pushed to an image repository corresponding to an extension defines a new version of that extension. Image tags are used to identify version numbers. Extension versions must follow semver to make it easy to understand and compare versions.

Docker Desktop scans the list of extensions published in the marketplace for new versions, and provides notifications to users when they can upgrade a specific extension. Extensions that aren't part of the Marketplace don't have automatic update notifications at the moment.

Users can download and install the newer version of any extension without updating Docker Desktop itself.

## Extension API dependencies

Extensions must specify the Extension API version they rely on. Docker Desktop checks the extension's required version, and only proposes to install extensions that are compatible with the current Docker Desktop version installed. Users might need to update Docker Desktop in order to install the latest extensions available.

Extension image labels must specify the API version that the extension relies upon. This allows Docker Desktop to inspect newer versions of extension images without downloading the full extension image upfront.

## License on extensions and the extension SDK

The [Docker Extension SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@docker/extension-api-client) is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License and is free to use.

There is no constraint on how each extension should be licensed, this is up to you to decide when creating a new extension.

---

## Extension image labels

# Extension image labels

Extensions use image labels to provide additional information such as a title, description, screenshots, and more.

This information is then displayed as an overview of the extension, so users can choose to install it.

![An extension overview, generated from labels](/extensions/extensions-sdk/extensions/labels/images/marketplace-details.png)

You can define [image labels](/reference/dockerfile/#label) in the extension's `Dockerfile`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If any of the **required** labels are missing in the `Dockerfile`, Docker Desktop considers the extension invalid and doesn't list it in the Marketplace.

Here is the list of labels you can or need to specify when building your extension:

| Label                                       | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Preview the extension in the Marketplace

You can validate that the image labels render as you expect.

When you create and install your unpublished extension, you can preview the extension in the Marketplace's **Managed** tab. You can see how the extension labels render in the list and in the details page of the extension.

> Preview extensions already listed in Marketplace
>
> When you install a local image of an extension already published in the Marketplace, for example with the tag `latest`, your local image is not detected as "unpublished".
>
> You can re-tag your image in order to have a different image name that's not listed as a published extension.
> Use `docker tag org/published-extension unpublished-extension` and then `docker extension install unpublished-extension`.

## Build multi-arch extensions

# Build multi-arch extensions

It is highly recommended that, at a minimum, your extension is supported for the following architectures:

- `linux/amd64`
- `linux/arm64`

Docker Desktop retrieves the extension image according to the user鈥檚 system architecture. If the extension does not provide an image that matches the user鈥檚 system architecture, Docker Desktop is not able to install the extension. As a result, users can鈥檛 run the extension in Docker Desktop.

## Build and push for multiple architectures

If you created an extension from the `docker extension init` command, the
`Makefile` at the root of the directory includes a target with name
`push-extension`.

You can run `make push-extension` to build your extension against both
`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms, and push them to Docker Hub.

For example:

```console
$ make push-extension
```

Alternatively, if you started from an empty directory, use the command below
to build your extension for multiple architectures:

```console
$ docker buildx build --push --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --tag=username/my-extension:0.0.1 .
```

You can then check the image manifest to see if the image is available for both
architectures using the [`docker buildx imagetools` command](/reference/cli/docker/buildx/imagetools/):

```console
$ docker buildx imagetools inspect username/my-extension:0.0.1
Name:      docker.io/username/my-extension:0.0.1
MediaType: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json
Digest:    sha256:f3b552e65508d9203b46db507bb121f1b644e53a22f851185d8e53d873417c48

Manifests:
  Name:      docker.io/username/my-extension:0.0.1@sha256:71d7ecf3cd12d9a99e73ef448bf63ae12751fe3a436a007cb0969f0dc4184c8c
  MediaType: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json
  Platform:  linux/amd64

  Name:      docker.io/username/my-extension:0.0.1@sha256:5ba4ceea65579fdd1181dfa103cc437d8e19d87239683cf5040e633211387ccf
  MediaType: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json
  Platform:  linux/arm64
```

> [!TIP]
>
> If you're having trouble pushing the image, make sure you're signed in to Docker Hub. Otherwise, run `docker login` to authenticate.

For more information, see [Multi-platform images](/build/building/multi-platform/) page.

## Adding multi-arch binaries

If your extension includes some binaries that deploy to the host, it鈥檚 important that they also have the right architecture when building the extension against multiple architectures.

Currently, Docker does not provide a way to explicitly specify multiple binaries for every architecture in the `metadata.json` file. However, you can add architecture-specific binaries depending on the `TARGETARCH` in the extension鈥檚 `Dockerfile`.

The following example shows an extension that uses a binary as part of its operations. The extension needs to run both in Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows.

In the `Dockerfile`, download the binary depending on the target architecture:

```Dockerfile
#syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.3-labs

FROM alpine AS dl
WORKDIR /tmp
RUN apk add --no-cache curl tar
ARG TARGETARCH
RUN <<EOT ash
    mkdir -p /out/darwin
    curl -fSsLo /out/darwin/kubectl "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -Ls https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/${TARGETARCH}/kubectl"
    chmod a+x /out/darwin/kubectl
EOT
RUN <<EOT ash
    if [ "amd64" = "$TARGETARCH" ]; then
        mkdir -p /out/windows
        curl -fSsLo /out/windows/kubectl.exe "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -Ls https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe"
    fi
EOT

FROM alpine
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="example-extension" \
    org.opencontainers.image.description="My Example Extension" \
    org.opencontainers.image.vendor="Docker Inc." \
    com.docker.desktop.extension.api.version=">= 0.3.3"

COPY --from=dl /out /
```

In the `metadata.json` file, specify the path for every binary on every platform:

```json
{
  "icon": "docker.svg",
  "ui": {
    "dashboard-tab": {
      "title": "Example Extension",
      "src": "index.html",
      "root": "ui"
    }
  },
  "host": {
    "binaries": [
      {
        "darwin": [
          {
            "path": "/darwin/kubectl"
          }
        ],
        "windows": [
          {
            "path": "/windows/kubectl.exe"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

As a result, when `TARGETARCH` equals:

- `arm64`, the `kubectl` binary fetched corresponds to the `arm64` architecture, and is copied to `/darwin/kubectl` in the final stage.
- `amd64`, two `kubectl` binaries are fetched. One for Darwin and another for Windows. They are copied to `/darwin/kubectl` and `/windows/kubectl.exe` respectively, in the final stage.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The binary destination path for Darwin is `darwin/kubectl` in both cases. The only change is the architecture-specific binary that is downloaded.

When the extension is installed, the extension framework copies the binaries from the extension image at `/darwin/kubectl` for Darwin, or `/windows/kubectl.exe` for Windows, to a specific location in the user鈥檚 host filesystem.

## Can I develop extensions that run Windows containers?

Although Docker Extensions is supported on Docker Desktop for Windows, Mac, and Linux, the extension framework only supports Linux containers. Therefore, you must target `linux` as the OS when you build your extension image.

## Publish in the Marketplace

# Publish in the Marketplace

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> New submissions to the Docker Extensions Marketplace are paused while Docker reviews Marketplace security. You can still update existing extensions, and private Marketplace extensions are unaffected. Contact extensions@docker.com if you have additional questions.

## Submit your extension to the Marketplace

Docker Desktop displays published extensions in the Extensions Marketplace on [Docker Desktop](https://open.docker.com/extensions/marketplace) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=extension).
The Extensions Marketplace is a space where developers can discover extensions to improve their developer experience and propose their own extension to be available for all Desktop users.

Whenever you are [ready to publish](/extensions/extensions-sdk/extensions/publish/DISTRIBUTION/) your extension in the Marketplace, you can [self-publish your extension](https://github.com/docker/extensions-submissions/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=1_automatic_review.yaml&title=%5BSubmission%5D%3A+)

> [!NOTE]
>
> As the Extension Marketplace continues to add new features for both Extension users and publishers, you are expected
> to maintain your extension over time to ensure it stays available in the Marketplace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Docker manual review process for extensions is paused at the moment. Submit your extension through the [automated submission process](https://github.com/docker/extensions-submissions/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=1_automatic_review.yaml&title=%5BSubmission%5D%3A+)

### Before you submit

Before you submit your extension, it must pass the [validation](/extensions/extensions-sdk/extensions/publish/validate/) checks.

It is highly recommended that your extension follows the guidelines outlined in this section before submitting your
extension. If you request a review from the Docker Extensions team and have not followed the guidelines, the review process may take longer. 

These guidelines don't replace Docker's terms of service or guarantee approval:
- Review the [design guidelines](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/design-guidelines/)
- Ensure the [UI styling](/extensions/extensions-sdk/design/) is in line with Docker Desktop guidelines
- Ensure your extensions support both light and dark mode
- Consider the needs of both new and existing users of your extension
- Test your extension with potential users
- Test your extension for crashes, bugs, and performance issues
- Test your extension on various platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux)
- Read the [Terms of Service](https://www.docker.com/legal/extensions_marketplace_developer_agreement/)

#### Validation process

Submitted extensions go through an automated validation process. If all the validation checks pass successfully, the extension is
published on the Marketplace and accessible to all users within a few hours.
It is the fastest way to get developers the tools they need and to get feedback from them as you work to
evolve/polish your extension.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Docker Desktop caches the list of extensions available in the Marketplace for 12 hours. If you don't see your
> extension in the Marketplace, you can restart Docker Desktop to force the cache to refresh.
