docker compose
docker compose

Description	Docker Compose
Usage	docker compose
Description

Define and run multi-container applications with Docker

Options
Option	Default	Description
--all-resources		Include all resources, even those not used by services
--ansi	auto	Control when to print ANSI control characters ("never"|"always"|"auto")

--compatibility		Run compose in backward compatibility mode
--dry-run		Execute command in dry run mode
--env-file		Specify an alternate environment file
-f, --file		Compose configuration files
--parallel	-1	Control max parallelism, -1 for unlimited
--profile		Specify a profile to enable
--progress		Set type of progress output (auto, tty, plain, json, quiet)
--project-directory		Specify an alternate working directory
(default: the path of the, first specified, Compose file)
-p, --project-name		Project name
Examples
Use -f to specify the name and path of one or more Compose files

Use the -f flag to specify the location of a Compose configuration file.

Specifying multiple Compose files

You can supply multiple -f configuration files. When you supply multiple files, Compose combines them into a single configuration. Compose builds the configuration in the order you supply the files. Subsequent files override and add to their predecessors.

For example, consider this command line:

$ docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.admin.yaml run backup_db

The compose.yaml file might specify a webapp service.

services:

  webapp:

    image: examples/web

    ports:

      - "8000:8000"

    volumes:

      - "/data"

If the compose.admin.yaml also specifies this same service, any matching fields override the previous file. New values, add to the webapp service configuration.

services:

  webapp:

    build: .

    environment:

      - DEBUG=1

When you use multiple Compose files, all paths in the files are relative to the first configuration file specified with -f. You can use the --project-directory option to override this base path.

Use a -f with - (dash) as the filename to read the configuration from stdin. When stdin is used all paths in the configuration are relative to the current working directory.

The -f flag is optional. If you don’t provide this flag on the command line, Compose traverses the working directory and its parent directories looking for a compose.yaml or docker-compose.yaml file.

Specifying a path to a single Compose file

You can use the -f flag to specify a path to a Compose file that is not located in the current directory, either from the command line or by setting up a COMPOSE_FILE environment variable in your shell or in an environment file.

For an example of using the -f option at the command line, suppose you are running the Compose Rails sample, and have a compose.yaml file in a directory called sandbox/rails. You can use a command like docker compose pull to get the postgres image for the db service from anywhere by using the -f flag as follows:

$ docker compose -f ~/sandbox/rails/compose.yaml pull db

Using an OCI published artifact

You can use the -f flag with the oci:// prefix to reference a Compose file that has been published to an OCI registry. This allows you to distribute and version your Compose configurations as OCI artifacts.

To use a Compose file from an OCI registry:

$ docker compose -f oci://registry.example.com/my-compose-project:latest up

You can also combine OCI artifacts with local files:

$ docker compose -f oci://registry.example.com/my-compose-project:v1.0 -f compose.override.yaml up

The OCI artifact must contain a valid Compose file. You can publish Compose files to an OCI registry using the docker compose publish command.

Using a git repository

You can use the -f flag to reference a Compose file from a git repository. Compose supports various git URL formats:

Using HTTPS:

$ docker compose -f https://github.com/user/repo.git up

Using SSH:

$ docker compose -f git@github.com:user/repo.git up

You can specify a specific branch, tag, or commit:

$ docker compose -f https://github.com/user/repo.git@main up

$ docker compose -f https://github.com/user/repo.git@v1.0.0 up

$ docker compose -f https://github.com/user/repo.git@abc123 up

You can also specify a subdirectory within the repository:

$ docker compose -f https://github.com/user/repo.git#main:path/to/compose.yaml up

When using git resources, Compose will clone the repository and use the specified Compose file. You can combine git resources with local files:

$ docker compose -f https://github.com/user/repo.git -f compose.override.yaml up

Use -p to specify a project name

Each configuration has a project name. Compose sets the project name using the following mechanisms, in order of precedence:

The -p command line flag
The COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable
The top level name: variable from the config file (or the last name: from a series of config files specified using -f)
The basename of the project directory containing the config file (or containing the first config file specified using -f)
The basename of the current directory if no config file is specified Project names must contain only lowercase letters, decimal digits, dashes, and underscores, and must begin with a lowercase letter or decimal digit. If the basename of the project directory or current directory violates this constraint, you must use one of the other mechanisms.
$ docker compose -p my_project ps -a

NAME                 SERVICE    STATUS     PORTS

my_project_demo_1    demo       running

$ docker compose -p my_project logs

demo_1  | PING localhost (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes

demo_1  | 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.095 ms

Use profiles to enable optional services

Use --profile to specify one or more active profiles Calling docker compose --profile frontend up starts the services with the profile frontend and services without any specified profiles. You can also enable multiple profiles, e.g. with docker compose --profile frontend --profile debug up the profiles frontend and debug is enabled.

Profiles can also be set by COMPOSE_PROFILES environment variable.

Configuring parallelism

Use --parallel to specify the maximum level of parallelism for concurrent engine calls. Calling docker compose --parallel 1 pull pulls the pullable images defined in the Compose file one at a time. This can also be used to control build concurrency.

Parallelism can also be set by the COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT environment variable.

Set up environment variables

You can set environment variables for various docker compose options, including the -f, -p and --profiles flags.

Setting the COMPOSE_FILE environment variable is equivalent to passing the -f flag, COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable does the same as the -p flag, COMPOSE_PROFILES environment variable is equivalent to the --profiles flag and COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT does the same as the --parallel flag.

If flags are explicitly set on the command line, the associated environment variable is ignored.

Setting the COMPOSE_IGNORE_ORPHANS environment variable to true stops docker compose from detecting orphaned containers for the project.

Setting the COMPOSE_MENU environment variable to false disables the helper menu when running docker compose up in attached mode. Alternatively, you can also run docker compose up --menu=false to disable the helper menu.

Use Dry Run mode to test your command

Use --dry-run flag to test a command without changing your application stack state. Dry Run mode shows you all the steps Compose applies when executing a command, for example:

$ docker compose --dry-run up --build -d

From the example above, you can see that the first step is to pull the image defined by db service, then build the backend service. Next, the containers are created. The db service is started, and the backend and proxy wait until the db service is healthy before starting.

Dry Run mode works with almost all commands. You cannot use Dry Run mode with a command that doesn't change the state of a Compose stack such as ps, ls, logs for example.
