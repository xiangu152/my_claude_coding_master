How to monkeypatch/mock modules and environments

Sometimes tests need to invoke functionality which depends on global settings or which invokes code which cannot be easily tested such as network access. The monkeypatch fixture helps you to safely set/delete an attribute, dictionary item or environment variable, or to modify sys.path for importing.

The monkeypatch fixture provides these helper methods for safely patching and mocking functionality in tests:

monkeypatch.setattr(obj, name, value, raising=True)

monkeypatch.delattr(obj, name, raising=True)

monkeypatch.setitem(mapping, name, value)

monkeypatch.delitem(obj, name, raising=True)

monkeypatch.setenv(name, value, prepend=None)

monkeypatch.delenv(name, raising=True)

monkeypatch.syspath_prepend(path)

monkeypatch.chdir(path)

monkeypatch.context()

All modifications will be undone after the requesting test function or fixture has finished. The raising parameter determines if a KeyError or AttributeError will be raised if the target of the set/deletion operation does not exist.

Consider the following scenarios:

1. Modifying the behavior of a function or the property of a class for a test e.g. there is an API call or database connection you will not make for a test but you know what the expected output should be. Use monkeypatch.setattr to patch the function or property with your desired testing behavior. This can include your own functions. Use monkeypatch.delattr to remove the function or property for the test.

2. Modifying the values of dictionaries e.g. you have a global configuration that you want to modify for certain test cases. Use monkeypatch.setitem to patch the dictionary for the test. monkeypatch.delitem can be used to remove items.

3. Modifying environment variables for a test e.g. to test program behavior if an environment variable is missing, or to set multiple values to a known variable. monkeypatch.setenv and monkeypatch.delenv can be used for these patches.

4. Use monkeypatch.setenv("PATH", value, prepend=os.pathsep) to modify $PATH, and monkeypatch.chdir to change the context of the current working directory during a test.

5. Use monkeypatch.syspath_prepend to modify sys.path which will also call pkg_resources.fixup_namespace_packages and importlib.invalidate_caches().

6. Use monkeypatch.context to apply patches only in a specific scope, which can help control teardown of complex fixtures or patches to the stdlib.

See the monkeypatch blog post for some introduction material and a discussion of its motivation.

Monkeypatching functions

Consider a scenario where you are working with user directories. In the context of testing, you do not want your test to depend on the running user. monkeypatch can be used to patch functions dependent on the user to always return a specific value.

In this example, monkeypatch.setattr is used to patch Path.home so that the known testing path Path("/abc") is always used when the test is run. This removes any dependency on the running user for testing purposes. monkeypatch.setattr must be called before the function which will use the patched function is called. After the test function finishes the Path.home modification will be undone.

# contents of test_module.py with source code and the test
```python
from pathlib import Path

def getssh():
    """Simple function to return expanded homedir ssh path."""
    return Path.home() / ".ssh"

def test_getssh(monkeypatch):
    # mocked return function to replace Path.home
    # always return '/abc'
    def mockreturn():
        return Path("/abc")

    # Application of the monkeypatch to replace Path.home
    # with the behavior of mockreturn defined above.
    monkeypatch.setattr(Path, "home", mockreturn)

    # Calling getssh() will use mockreturn in place of Path.home
    # for this test with the monkeypatch.
    x = getssh()
    assert x == Path("/abc/.ssh")
```
Monkeypatching returned objects: building mock classes

monkeypatch.setattr can be used in conjunction with classes to mock returned objects from functions instead of values. Imagine a simple function to take an API url and return the json response.

# contents of app.py, a simple API retrieval example
```python
import requests

def get_json(url):
    """Takes a URL, and returns the JSON."""
    r = requests.get(url)
    return r.json()
```
We need to mock r, the returned response object for testing purposes. The mock of r needs a .json() method which returns a dictionary. This can be done in our test file by defining a class to represent r.

# contents of test_app.py, a simple test for our API retrieval
# import requests for the purposes of monkeypatching
```python
import requests

# our app.py that includes the get_json() function
# this is the previous code block example
```
```python
import app

# custom class to be the mock return value
# will override the requests.Response returned from requests.get
class MockResponse:
    # mock json() method always returns a specific testing dictionary
    @staticmethod
    def json():
        return {"mock_key": "mock_response"}

def test_get_json(monkeypatch):
    # Any arguments may be passed and mock_get() will always return our
    # mocked object, which only has the .json() method.
    def mock_get(*args, **kwargs):
        return MockResponse()

    # apply the monkeypatch for requests.get to mock_get
    monkeypatch.setattr(requests, "get", mock_get)

    # app.get_json, which contains requests.get, uses the monkeypatch
    result = app.get_json("https://fakeurl")
    assert result["mock_key"] == "mock_response"
```
monkeypatch applies the mock for requests.get with our mock_get function. The mock_get function returns an instance of the MockResponse class, which has a json() method defined to return a known testing dictionary and does not require any outside API connection.

You can build the MockResponse class with the appropriate degree of complexity for the scenario you are testing. For instance, it could include an ok property that always returns True, or return different values from the json() mocked method based on input strings.

This mock can be shared across tests using a fixture:

# contents of test_app.py, a simple test for our API retrieval
import pytest
```python
import requests

# app.py that includes the get_json() function
```
```python
import app

# custom class to be the mock return value of requests.get()
class MockResponse:
    @staticmethod
    def json():
        return {"mock_key": "mock_response"}

# monkeypatched requests.get moved to a fixture
@pytest.fixture
def mock_response(monkeypatch):
    """Requests.get() mocked to return {'mock_key':'mock_response'}."""

    def mock_get(*args, **kwargs):
        return MockResponse()

    monkeypatch.setattr(requests, "get", mock_get)

# notice our test uses the custom fixture instead of monkeypatch directly
def test_get_json(mock_response):
    result = app.get_json("https://fakeurl")
    assert result["mock_key"] == "mock_response"
```
Furthermore, if the mock was designed to be applied to all tests, the fixture could be moved to a conftest.py file and use the with autouse=True option.

Global patch example: preventing “requests” from remote operations

If you want to prevent the “requests” library from performing http requests in all your tests, you can do:

# contents of conftest.py
```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def no_requests(monkeypatch):
    """Remove requests.sessions.Session.request for all tests."""
    monkeypatch.delattr("requests.sessions.Session.request")
```
This autouse fixture will be executed for each test function and it will delete the method request.session.Session.request so that any attempts within tests to create http requests will fail.

Note

Be advised that it is not recommended to patch builtin functions such as open, compile, etc., because it might break pytest’s internals. If that’s unavoidable, passing --tb=native, --assert=plain and --capture=no might help although there’s no guarantee.

Note

Mind that patching stdlib functions and some third-party libraries used by pytest might break pytest itself. Prefer patching the reference that your code uses instead of patching the original object in the standard library. For example, if your module does from os import getcwd, patch mymodule.getcwd rather than os.getcwd.

For code that you control, a safer long-term pattern is to make dependencies explicit so they can be passed into the code under test instead of patched globally. When patching a stdlib object is unavoidable, use MonkeyPatch.context() to limit the patching to the block you want tested:

```python
import functools

def test_partial(monkeypatch):
    with monkeypatch.context() as m:
        m.setattr(functools, "partial", 3)
        assert functools.partial == 3
```
See #3290 for details.

Monkeypatching environment variables

If you are working with environment variables you often need to safely change the values or delete them from the system for testing purposes. monkeypatch provides a mechanism to do this using the setenv and delenv method. Our example code to test:

# contents of our original code file e.g. code.py
```python
import os

def get_os_user_lower():
    """Simple retrieval function.
    Returns lowercase USER or raises OSError."""
    username = os.getenv("USER")

    if username is None:
        raise OSError("USER environment is not set.")

    return username.lower()
```
There are two potential paths. First, the USER environment variable is set to a value. Second, the USER environment variable does not exist. Using monkeypatch both paths can be safely tested without impacting the running environment:

# contents of our test file e.g. test_code.py
```python
import pytest

def test_upper_to_lower(monkeypatch):
    """Set the USER env var to assert the behavior."""
    monkeypatch.setenv("USER", "TestingUser")
    assert get_os_user_lower() == "testinguser"

def test_raise_exception(monkeypatch):
    """Remove the USER env var and assert OSError is raised."""
    monkeypatch.delenv("USER", raising=False)

    with pytest.raises(OSError):
        _ = get_os_user_lower()
```
This behavior can be moved into fixture structures and shared across tests:

# contents of our test file e.g. test_code.py
```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def mock_env_user(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("USER", "TestingUser")

@pytest.fixture
def mock_env_missing(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.delenv("USER", raising=False)

# notice the tests reference the fixtures for mocks
def test_upper_to_lower(mock_env_user):
    assert get_os_user_lower() == "testinguser"

def test_raise_exception(mock_env_missing):
    with pytest.raises(OSError):
        _ = get_os_user_lower()
```
Monkeypatching dictionaries

monkeypatch.setitem can be used to safely set the values of dictionaries to specific values during tests. Take this simplified connection string example:

# contents of app.py to generate a simple connection string
DEFAULT_CONFIG = {"user": "user1", "database": "db1"}

def create_connection_string(config=None):
```python
    """Creates a connection string from input or defaults."""
    config = config or DEFAULT_CONFIG
    return f"User Id={config['user']}; Location={config['database']};"
```
For testing purposes we can patch the DEFAULT_CONFIG dictionary to specific values.

# contents of test_app.py
# app.py with the connection string function (prior code block)
```python
import app

def test_connection(monkeypatch):
    # Patch the values of DEFAULT_CONFIG to specific
    # testing values only for this test.
    monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", "test_user")
    monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "database", "test_db")

    # expected result based on the mocks
    expected = "User Id=test_user; Location=test_db;"

    # the test uses the monkeypatched dictionary settings
    result = app.create_connection_string()
    assert result == expected
```
You can use the monkeypatch.delitem to remove values.

# contents of test_app.py
```python
import pytest

# app.py with the connection string function
```
```python
import app

def test_missing_user(monkeypatch):
    # patch the DEFAULT_CONFIG to be missing the 'user' key
    monkeypatch.delitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", raising=False)

    # Key error expected because a config is not passed, and the
    # default is now missing the 'user' entry.
    with pytest.raises(KeyError):
        _ = app.create_connection_string()
```
The modularity of fixtures gives you the flexibility to define separate fixtures for each potential mock and reference them in the needed tests.

# contents of test_app.py
```python
import pytest

# app.py with the connection string function
```
```python
import app

# all of the mocks are moved into separated fixtures
@pytest.fixture
def mock_test_user(monkeypatch):
    """Set the DEFAULT_CONFIG user to test_user."""
    monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", "test_user")

@pytest.fixture
def mock_test_database(monkeypatch):
    """Set the DEFAULT_CONFIG database to test_db."""
    monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "database", "test_db")

@pytest.fixture
def mock_missing_default_user(monkeypatch):
    """Remove the user key from DEFAULT_CONFIG"""
    monkeypatch.delitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", raising=False)

# tests reference only the fixture mocks that are needed
def test_connection(mock_test_user, mock_test_database):
    expected = "User Id=test_user; Location=test_db;"

    result = app.create_connection_string()
    assert result == expected

def test_missing_user(mock_missing_default_user):
    with pytest.raises(KeyError):
        _ = app.create_connection_string()
```
