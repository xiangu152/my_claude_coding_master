Writing plugins

It is easy to implement local conftest plugins for your own project or pip-installable plugins that can be used throughout many projects, including third party projects. Please refer to How to install and use plugins if you only want to use but not write plugins.

A plugin contains one or multiple hook functions. Writing hooks explains the basics and details of how you can write a hook function yourself. pytest implements all aspects of configuration, collection, running and reporting by calling well specified hooks of the following plugins:

builtin plugins: loaded from pytest’s internal _pytest directory.

external plugins: installed third-party modules discovered through entry points in their packaging metadata

conftest.py plugins: modules auto-discovered in test directories

In principle, each hook call is a 1:N Python function call where N is the number of registered implementation functions for a given specification. All specifications and implementations follow the pytest_ prefix naming convention, making them easy to distinguish and find.

Plugin discovery order at tool startup

pytest loads plugin modules at tool startup in the following way:

by scanning the command line for the -p no:name option and blocking that plugin from being loaded (even builtin plugins can be blocked this way). This happens before normal command-line parsing.

by loading all builtin plugins.

by scanning the command line for the -p name option and loading the specified plugin. This happens before normal command-line parsing.

by loading all plugins registered through installed third-party package entry points, unless the PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD environment variable is set.

by loading all plugins specified through the PYTEST_PLUGINS environment variable.

by loading all “initial” conftest.py files:

determine the test paths: specified on the command line, otherwise in testpaths if defined and running from the rootdir, otherwise the current dir

for each test path, load conftest.py and test*/conftest.py relative to the directory part of the test path, if exist. Before a conftest.py file is loaded, load conftest.py files in all of its parent directories. After a conftest.py file is loaded, recursively load all plugins specified in its pytest_plugins variable if present.

conftest.py: local per-directory plugins

Local conftest.py plugins contain directory-specific hook implementations. Hook Session and test running activities will invoke all hooks defined in conftest.py files closer to the root of the filesystem. Example of implementing the pytest_runtest_setup hook so that is called for tests in the a sub directory but not for other directories:

a/conftest.py:
```python
    def pytest_runtest_setup(item):
        # called for running each test in 'a' directory
        print("setting up", item)
```
a/test_sub.py:
```python
    def test_sub():
        pass
```
test_flat.py:
```python
    def test_flat():
        pass
```
Here is how you might run it:

pytest test_flat.py --capture=no  # will not show "setting up"
pytest a/test_sub.py --capture=no  # will show "setting up"

Note

If you have conftest.py files which do not reside in a python package directory (i.e. one containing an __init__.py) then “import conftest” can be ambiguous because there might be other conftest.py files as well on your PYTHONPATH or sys.path. It is thus good practice for projects to either put conftest.py under a package scope or to never import anything from a conftest.py file.

See also: pytest import mechanisms and sys.path/PYTHONPATH.

Note

Some hooks cannot be implemented in conftest.py files which are not initial due to how pytest discovers plugins during startup. See the documentation of each hook for details.

Writing your own plugin

If you want to write a plugin, there are many real-life examples you can copy from:

a custom collection example plugin: A basic example for specifying tests in Yaml files

builtin plugins which provide pytest’s own functionality

many external plugins providing additional features

All of these plugins implement hooks and/or fixtures to extend and add functionality.

Note

Make sure to check out the excellent cookiecutter-pytest-plugin project, which is a cookiecutter template for authoring plugins.

The template provides an excellent starting point with a working plugin, tests running with tox, a comprehensive README file as well as a pre-configured entry-point.

Also consider contributing your plugin to pytest-dev once it has some happy users other than yourself.

Making your plugin installable by others

If you want to make your plugin externally available, you may define a so-called entry point for your distribution so that pytest finds your plugin module. Entry points are a feature that is provided by packaging tools.

pytest looks up the pytest11 entrypoint to discover its plugins, thus you can make your plugin available by defining it in your pyproject.toml file.

# sample ./pyproject.toml file
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "myproject"
classifiers = [
    "Framework :: Pytest",
]

[project.entry-points.pytest11]
myproject = "myproject.pluginmodule"

If a package is installed this way, pytest will load myproject.pluginmodule as a plugin which can define hooks. Confirm registration with pytest --trace-config

Note

Make sure to include Framework :: Pytest in your list of PyPI classifiers to make it easy for users to find your plugin.

Assertion Rewriting

One of the main features of pytest is the use of plain assert statements and the detailed introspection of expressions upon assertion failures. This is provided by “assertion rewriting” which modifies the parsed AST before it gets compiled to bytecode. This is done via a PEP 302 import hook which gets installed early on when pytest starts up and will perform this rewriting when modules get imported. However, since we do not want to test different bytecode from what you will run in production, this hook only rewrites test modules themselves (as defined by the python_files configuration option), and any modules which are part of plugins. Any other imported module will not be rewritten and normal assertion behaviour will happen.

If you have assertion helpers in other modules where you would need assertion rewriting to be enabled you need to ask pytest explicitly to rewrite this module before it gets imported.

register_assert_rewrite(*names)
[source]

Register one or more module names to be rewritten on import.

This function will make sure that this module or all modules inside the package will get their assert statements rewritten. Thus you should make sure to call this before the module is actually imported, usually in your __init__.py if you are a plugin using a package.

PARAMETERS:

names – The module names to register.

This is especially important when you write a pytest plugin which is created using a package. The import hook only treats conftest.py files and any modules which are listed in the pytest11 entrypoint as plugins. As an example consider the following package:

pytest_foo/__init__.py
pytest_foo/plugin.py
pytest_foo/helper.py

With the following typical setup.py extract:

setup(..., entry_points={"pytest11": ["foo = pytest_foo.plugin"]}, ...)

In this case only pytest_foo/plugin.py will be rewritten. If the helper module also contains assert statements which need to be rewritten it needs to be marked as such, before it gets imported. This is easiest by marking it for rewriting inside the __init__.py module, which will always be imported first when a module inside a package is imported. This way plugin.py can still import helper.py normally. The contents of pytest_foo/__init__.py will then need to look like this:

import pytest
pytest.register_assert_rewrite("pytest_foo.helper")
Requiring/Loading plugins in a test module or conftest file

You can require plugins in a test module or a conftest.py file using pytest_plugins:

pytest_plugins = ["name1", "name2"]

When the test module or conftest plugin is loaded the specified plugins will be loaded as well. Any module can be blessed as a plugin, including internal application modules:

pytest_plugins = "myapp.testsupport.myplugin"

pytest_plugins are processed recursively, so note that in the example above if myapp.testsupport.myplugin also declares pytest_plugins, the contents of the variable will also be loaded as plugins, and so on.

Note

Requiring plugins using pytest_plugins variable in non-root conftest.py files is deprecated.

This is important because conftest.py files implement per-directory hook implementations, but once a plugin is imported, it will affect the entire directory tree. In order to avoid confusion, defining pytest_plugins in any conftest.py file which is not located in the tests root directory is deprecated, and will raise a warning.

This mechanism makes it easy to share fixtures within applications or even external applications without the need to create external plugins using the entry point packaging metadata technique.

Plugins imported by pytest_plugins will also automatically be marked for assertion rewriting (see pytest.register_assert_rewrite()). However for this to have any effect the module must not be imported already; if it was already imported at the time the pytest_plugins statement is processed, a warning will result and assertions inside the plugin will not be rewritten. To fix this you can either call pytest.register_assert_rewrite() yourself before the module is imported, or you can arrange the code to delay the importing until after the plugin is registered.

Accessing another plugin by name

If a plugin wants to collaborate with code from another plugin it can obtain a reference through the plugin manager like this:

plugin = config.pluginmanager.get_plugin("name_of_plugin")

If you want to look at the names of existing plugins, use the --trace-config option.

Registering custom markers

If your plugin uses any markers, you should register them so that they appear in pytest’s help text and do not cause spurious warnings. For example, the following plugin would register cool_marker and mark_with for all users:

def pytest_configure(config):
    config.addinivalue_line("markers", "cool_marker: this one is for cool tests.")
    config.addinivalue_line(
        "markers", "mark_with(arg, arg2): this marker takes arguments."
    )
Testing plugins

pytest comes with a plugin named pytester that helps you write tests for your plugin code. The plugin is disabled by default, so you will have to enable it before you can use it.

You can do so by adding the following line to a conftest.py file in your testing directory:

# content of conftest.py

pytest_plugins = ["pytester"]

Alternatively you can invoke pytest with the -p pytester command line option.

This will allow you to use the pytester fixture for testing your plugin code.

Let’s demonstrate what you can do with the plugin with an example. Imagine we developed a plugin that provides a fixture hello which yields a function and we can invoke this function with one optional parameter. It will return a string value of Hello World! if we do not supply a value or Hello {value}! if we do supply a string value.

```python
import pytest

def pytest_addoption(parser):
    group = parser.getgroup("helloworld")
    group.addoption(
        "--name",
        action="store",
        dest="name",
        default="World",
        help='Default "name" for hello().',
    )

@pytest.fixture
def hello(request):
    name = request.config.getoption("name")

    def _hello(name=None):
        if not name:
            name = request.config.getoption("name")
        return f"Hello {name}!"

    return _hello
```
Now the pytester fixture provides a convenient API for creating temporary conftest.py files and test files. It also allows us to run the tests and return a result object, with which we can assert the tests’ outcomes.

```python
def test_hello(pytester):
    """Make sure that our plugin works."""

    # create a temporary conftest.py file
    pytester.makeconftest(
        """
        import pytest

        @pytest.fixture(params=[
            "Brianna",
            "Andreas",
            "Floris",
        ])
        def name(request):
            return request.param
    """
    )

    # create a temporary pytest test file
    pytester.makepyfile(
        """
        def test_hello_default(hello):
            assert hello() == "Hello World!"

        def test_hello_name(hello, name):
            assert hello(name) == "Hello {0}!".format(name)
    """
    )

    # run all tests with pytest
    result = pytester.runpytest()

    # check that all 4 tests passed
    result.assert_outcomes(passed=4)
```
Additionally it is possible to copy examples to the pytester’s isolated environment before running pytest on it. This way we can abstract the tested logic to separate files, which is especially useful for longer tests and/or longer conftest.py files.

Note that for pytester.copy_example to work we need to set pytester_example_dir in our configuration file to tell pytest where to look for example files.

# content of pytest.toml
[pytest]
pytester_example_dir = "."

# content of test_example.py

```python
def test_plugin(pytester):
    pytester.copy_example("test_example.py")
    pytester.runpytest("-k", "test_example")

def test_example():
    pass
```
```bash
$ pytest
