Models

One of the primary ways of defining schema in Pydantic is via models. Models are simply classes which inherit from BaseModel and define fields as annotated attributes.

You can think of models as similar to structs in languages like C, or as the requirements of a single endpoint in an API.

Models share many similarities with Python’s dataclasses, but have been designed with some subtle-yet-important differences that streamline certain workflows related to validation, serialization, and JSON schema generation. You can find more discussion of this in the Dataclasses section of the docs.

Untrusted data can be passed to a model and, after parsing and validation, Pydantic guarantees that the fields of the resultant model instance will conform to the field types defined on the model.

Validation — a
deliberate
misnomer

TL;DR

We use the term “validation” to refer to the process of instantiating a model (or other type) that adheres to specified types and constraints. This task, which Pydantic is well known for, is most widely recognized as “validation” in colloquial terms, even though in other contexts the term “validation” may be more restrictive.

The long version

The potential confusion around the term “validation” arises from the fact that, strictly speaking, Pydantic’s primary focus doesn’t align precisely with the dictionary definition of “validation”:

validation

noun the action of checking or proving the validity or accuracy of something.

In Pydantic, the term “validation” refers to the process of instantiating a model (or other type) that adheres to specified types and constraints. Pydantic guarantees the types and constraints of the output, not the input data. This distinction becomes apparent when considering that Pydantic’s ValidationError is raised when data cannot be successfully parsed into a model instance.

While this distinction may initially seem subtle, it holds practical significance. In some cases, “validation” goes beyond just model creation, and can include the copying and coercion of data. This can involve copying arguments passed to the constructor in order to perform coercion to a new type without mutating the original input data. For a more in-depth understanding of the implications for your usage, refer to the Data Conversion and Attribute Copies sections below.

In essence, Pydantic’s primary goal is to assure that the resulting structure post-processing (termed “validation”) precisely conforms to the applied type hints. Given the widespread adoption of “validation” as the colloquial term for this process, we will consistently use it in our documentation.

While the terms “parse” and “validation” were previously used interchangeably, moving forward, we aim to exclusively employ “validate”, with “parse” reserved specifically for discussions related to JSON parsing.

Basic model usage

> **Note**

Pydantic relies heavily on the existing Python typing constructs to define models. If you are not familiar with those, the following resources can be useful:

The Type System Guides
The mypy documentation
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict
class User(BaseModel):
  id: int
  name: str = 'Jane Doe'
  model_config = ConfigDict(str_max_length=10)  
```

In this example, User is a model with two fields:

id, which is an integer (defined using the int type) and is required
name, which is a string (defined using the str type) and is not required (it has a default value).

The documentation on types expands on the supported types.

Fields can be customized in a number of ways using the Field() function. See the documentation on fields for more information.

The model can then be instantiated:

user = User(id='123')
user is an instance of User. Initialization of the object will perform all parsing and validation. If no ValidationError exception is raised, you know the resulting model instance is valid.

Fields of a model can be accessed as normal attributes of the user object:

assert user.name == 'Jane Doe'  
The model instance can be serialized using the model_dump() method:

assert user.model_dump() == {'id': 123, 'name': 'Jane Doe'}
Calling dict on the instance will also provide a dictionary, but nested fields will not be recursively converted into dictionaries. model_dump() also provides numerous arguments to customize the serialization result.

By default, models are mutable and field values can be changed through attribute assignment:

user.id = 321
assert user.id == 321
> **Caution**

When defining your models, watch out for naming collisions between your field name and its type annotation.

For example, the following will not behave as expected and would yield a validation error:

```python
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Boo(BaseModel):
    int: Optional[int] = None
m = Boo(int=123)  # Will fail to validate.
```

Because of how Python evaluates annotated assignment statements, the statement is equivalent to int: None = None, thus leading to a validation error.

Model methods and properties

The example above only shows the tip of the iceberg of what models can do. Model classes possess the following methods and attributes:

model_validate(): Validates the given object against the Pydantic model. See Validating data.
model_validate_json(): Validates the given JSON data against the Pydantic model. See Validating data.
model_construct(): Creates models without running validation. See Creating models without validation.
model_dump(): Returns a dictionary of the model’s fields and values. See Serialization.
model_dump_json(): Returns a JSON string representation of model_dump(). See Serialization.
model_copy(): Returns a copy (by default, shallow copy) of the model. See Model copy.
model_json_schema(): Returns a jsonable dictionary representing the model’s JSON Schema. See JSON Schema.
model_fields: A mapping between field names and their definitions (FieldInfo instances).
model_post_init(): Performs additional actions after the model is instantiated and all field validators are applied.
model_rebuild(): Rebuilds the model schema, which also supports building recursive generic models. See Rebuilding model schema.

Model instances possess the following attributes:

model_extra: The extra fields set during validation.
> **Note**

See the API documentation of BaseModel for the class definition including a full list of methods and attributes.

> **Tip**

See Changes to pydantic.BaseModel in the Migration Guide for details on changes from Pydantic V1.

Data conversion

Pydantic may cast input data to force it to conform to model field types, and in some cases this may result in a loss of information. For example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Model(BaseModel):
    a: int
    b: float
    c: str
print(Model(a=3.000, b='2.72', c=b'binary data').model_dump())
```
#> {'a': 3, 'b': 2.72, 'c': 'binary data'}

This is a deliberate decision of Pydantic, and is frequently the most useful approach. See this issue for a longer discussion on the subject.

Nevertheless, Pydantic provides a strict mode, where no data conversion is performed. Values must be of the same type as the declared field type.

This is also the case for collections. In most cases, you shouldn’t make use of abstract container classes and just use a concrete type, such as list:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Model(BaseModel):
  items: list[int]  
print(Model(items=(1, 2, 3)))
```
#> items=[1, 2, 3]

Besides, using these abstract types can also lead to poor validation performance, and in general using concrete container types will avoid unnecessary checks.

Extra data

By default, Pydantic models won’t error when you provide extra data, and these values will simply be ignored:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Model(BaseModel):
    x: int
m = Model(x=1, y='a')
assert m.model_dump() == {'x': 1}
```

The extra configuration value can be used to control this behavior:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict
class Model(BaseModel):
  x: int
  model_config = ConfigDict(extra='allow')
m = Model(x=1, y='a')  
assert m.model_dump() == {'x': 1, 'y': 'a'}
assert m.__pydantic_extra__ == {'y': 'a'}
```

The configuration can take three values:

'ignore': Providing extra data is ignored (the default).
'forbid': Providing extra data is not permitted.
'allow': Providing extra data is allowed and stored in the __pydantic_extra__ dictionary attribute. The __pydantic_extra__ can explicitly be annotated to provide validation for extra fields.

The validation methods (e.g. model_validate()) have an optional extra argument that will override the extra configuration value of the model for that validation call.

For more details, refer to the extra API documentation.

Pydantic dataclasses also support extra data (see the dataclass configuration section).

Nested models

More complex hierarchical data structures can be defined using models themselves as types in annotations.

```python
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Foo(BaseModel):
    count: int
    size: Optional[float] = None
class Bar(BaseModel):
    apple: str = 'x'
    banana: str = 'y'
class Spam(BaseModel):
    foo: Foo
    bars: list[Bar]
m = Spam(foo={'count': 4}, bars=[{'apple': 'x1'}, {'apple': 'x2'}])
print(m)
```
"""
foo=Foo(count=4, size=None) bars=[Bar(apple='x1', banana='y'), Bar(apple='x2', banana='y')]
"""
print(m.model_dump())
{
```python
    'foo': {'count': 4, 'size': None},
    'bars': [{'apple': 'x1', 'banana': 'y'}, {'apple': 'x2', 'banana': 'y'}],
```
}
"""

Self-referencing models are supported. For more details, see the documentation related to forward annotations.

Rebuilding model schema

When you define a model class in your code, Pydantic will analyze the body of the class to collect a variety of information required to perform validation and serialization, gathered in a core schema. Notably, the model’s type annotations are evaluated to understand the valid types for each field (more information can be found in the Architecture documentation). However, it might be the case that annotations refer to symbols not defined when the model class is being created. To circumvent this issue, the model_rebuild() method can be used:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, PydanticUserError
class Foo(BaseModel):
  x: 'Bar'  
try:
  Foo.model_json_schema()
except PydanticUserError as e:
  print(e)
  """
  `Foo` is not fully defined; you should define `Bar`, then call `Foo.model_rebuild()`.
  For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2/u/class-not-fully-defined
  """
class Bar(BaseModel):
  pass
```
Foo.model_rebuild()
print(Foo.model_json_schema())
{
  '$defs': {'Bar': {'properties': {}, 'title': 'Bar', 'type': 'object'}},
"""

Pydantic tries to determine when this is necessary automatically and error if it wasn’t done, but you may want to call model_rebuild() proactively when dealing with recursive models or generics.

In V2, model_rebuild() replaced update_forward_refs() from V1. There are some slight differences with the new behavior. The biggest change is that when calling model_rebuild() on the outermost model, it builds a core schema used for validation of the whole model (nested models and all), so all types at all levels need to be ready before model_rebuild() is called.

Validating data

Pydantic can validate data in three different modes: Python, JSON and strings.

The Python mode gets used when using:

The __init__() model constructor. Field values must be provided using keyword arguments.
model_validate(): data can be provided either as a dictionary, or as a model instance (by default, instances are assumed to be valid; see the revalidate_instances setting). Arbitrary objects can also be provided if explicitly enabled.

The JSON and strings modes can be used with dedicated methods:

model_validate_json(): data is validated as a JSON string or bytes object. If your incoming data is a JSON payload, this is generally considered faster (instead of manually parsing the data as a dictionary). Learn more about JSON parsing in the JSON documentation.
model_validate_strings(): data is validated as a dictionary (can be nested) with string keys and values and validates the data in JSON mode so that said strings can be coerced into the correct types.

Compared to using the model constructor, it is possible to control several validation parameters when using the model_validate_*() methods (strictness, extra data, validation context, etc.).

> **Note**

Depending on the types and model configuration involved, the Python and JSON modes may have different validation behavior (e.g. with strictness). If you have data coming from a non-JSON source, but want the same validation behavior and errors you’d get from the JSON mode, our recommendation for now is to either dump your data to JSON (e.g. using json.dumps()), or use model_validate_strings() if the data takes the form of a (potentially nested) dictionary with string keys and values. Progress for this feature can be tracked in this issue.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str = 'John Doe'
    signup_ts: Optional[datetime] = None
m = User.model_validate({'id': 123, 'name': 'James'})
print(m)
```
#> id=123 name='James' signup_ts=None
try:
m = User.model_validate_strings(
print(m)
try:

Pydantic also provides the model_construct() method, which allows models to be created without validation. This can be useful in at least a few cases:

when working with complex data that is already known to be valid (for performance reasons)
when one or more of the validator functions are non-idempotent
when one or more of the validator functions have side effects that you don’t want to be triggered.

> **Caution**

model_construct() does not do any validation, meaning it can create models which are invalid. You should only ever use the model_construct() method with data which has already been validated, or that you definitely trust.

> **Note**

In Pydantic V2, the performance gap between validation (either with direct instantiation or the model_validate* methods) and model_construct() has been narrowed considerably. For simple models, going with validation may even be faster. If you are using model_construct() for performance reasons, you may want to profile your use case before assuming it is actually faster.

Note that for root models, the root value can be passed to model_construct() positionally, instead of using a keyword argument.

Here are some additional notes on the behavior of model_construct():

When we say “no validation is performed” — this includes converting dictionaries to model instances. So if you have a field referring to a model type, you will need to convert the inner dictionary to a model yourself.
If you do not pass keyword arguments for fields with defaults, the default values will still be used.
For models with private attributes, the __pydantic_private__ dictionary will be populated the same as it would be when creating the model with validation.
No __init__ method from the model or any of its parent classes will be called, even when a custom __init__ method is defined.

On
extra data
behavior with
model_construct()

For models with extra set to 'allow', data not corresponding to fields will be correctly stored in the __pydantic_extra__ dictionary and saved to the model’s __dict__ attribute.
For models with extra set to 'ignore', data not corresponding to fields will be ignored — that is, not stored in __pydantic_extra__ or __dict__ on the instance.
Unlike when instantiating the model with validation, a call to model_construct() with extra set to 'forbid' doesn’t raise an error in the presence of data not corresponding to fields. Rather, said input data is simply ignored.
Defining a custom __init__()

Pydantic provides a default __init__() implementation for Pydantic models, that is called only when using the model constructor (and not with the model_validate_*() methods). This implementation delegates validation to pydantic-core.

However, it is possible to define a custom __init__() on your models. In this case, it will be called unconditionally from all the validation methods, without performing validation (and so you should call super().__init__(**kwargs) in your implementation).

Defining a custom __init__() is not recommended, as all the validation parameters (strictness, extra data behavior, validation context) will be lost. If you need to perform actions after the model was initialized, you can make use of after field or model validators, or define a model_post_init() implementation:

```python
import logging
from typing import Any
from pydantic import BaseModel
class MyModel(BaseModel):
    id: int
    def model_post_init(self, context: Any) -> None:
        logging.info("Model initialized with id %d", self.id)
```
Error handling

Pydantic will raise a ValidationError exception whenever it finds an error in the data it’s validating.

A single exception will be raised regardless of the number of errors found, and that validation error will contain information about all of the errors and how they happened.

See Error Handling for details on standard and custom errors.

As a demonstration:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
class Model(BaseModel):
    list_of_ints: list[int]
    a_float: float
data = {
    'list_of_ints': ['1', 2, 'bad'],
    'a_float': 'not a float',
```
}
try:

(Formerly known as “ORM Mode”/from_orm()).

When using the model_validate() method, Pydantic can also validate arbitrary objects, by getting attributes on the object corresponding the field names. One common application of this functionality is integration with object-relational mappings (ORMs).

This feature need to be manually enabled, either by setting the from_attributes configuration value, or by using the from_attributes parameter on model_validate().

The example here uses SQLAlchemy, but the same approach should work for any ORM.

```python
from typing import Annotated
from sqlalchemy import ARRAY, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, Mapped, mapped_column
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, StringConstraints
class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass
class CompanyOrm(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'companies'
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True, nullable=False)
    public_key: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(
        String(20), index=True, nullable=False, unique=True
    )
    domains: Mapped[list[str]] = mapped_column(ARRAY(String(255)))
class CompanyModel(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)
    id: int
    public_key: Annotated[str, StringConstraints(max_length=20)]
    domains: list[Annotated[str, StringConstraints(max_length=255)]]
co_orm = CompanyOrm(
    id=123,
    public_key='foobar',
    domains=['example.com', 'foobar.com'],
```
)
print(co_orm)
co_model = CompanyModel.model_validate(co_orm)
Nested attributes

When using attributes to validate models, model instances will be created from both top-level attributes and deeper-nested attributes as appropriate.

Here is an example demonstrating the principle:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict
class PetCls:
    def __init__(self, *, name: str) -> None:
        self.name = name
class PersonCls:
    def __init__(self, *, name: str, pets: list[PetCls]) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.pets = pets
class Pet(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)
    name: str
class Person(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)
    name: str
    pets: list[Pet]
bones = PetCls(name='Bones')
orion = PetCls(name='Orion')
anna = PersonCls(name='Anna', pets=[bones, orion])
anna_model = Person.model_validate(anna)
print(anna_model)
```
#> name='Anna' pets=[Pet(name='Bones'), Pet(name='Orion')]
Model copy

The model_copy() method allows models to be duplicated (with optional updates), which is particularly useful when working with frozen models.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
class BarModel(BaseModel):
    whatever: int
class FooBarModel(BaseModel):
    banana: float
    foo: str
    bar: BarModel
m = FooBarModel(banana=3.14, foo='hello', bar={'whatever': 123})
print(m.model_copy(update={'banana': 0}))
```
#> banana=0 foo='hello' bar=BarModel(whatever=123)
# normal copy gives the same object reference for bar:
# deep copy gives a new object reference for `bar`:
Generic models

Pydantic supports the creation of generic models to make it easier to reuse a common model structure. Both the new type parameter syntax (introduced by PEP 695 in Python 3.12) and the old syntax are supported (refer to the Python documentation for more details).

Here is an example using a generic Pydantic model to create an easily-reused HTTP response payload wrapper:

Python 3.9 and above
Python 3.12 and above (new syntax)
```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
DataT = TypeVar('DataT')  
class DataModel(BaseModel):
  number: int
class Response(BaseModel, Generic[DataT]):  
  data: DataT  
print(Response[int](data=1))
```
#> data=1
print(Response[str](data='value'))
print(Response[str](data='value').model_dump())
data = DataModel(number=1)
try:
New in v2.11

Full support for the type parameter syntax and type variable defaults.

> **Caution**

When parametrizing a model with a concrete type, Pydantic does not validate that the provided type is assignable to the type variable if it has an upper bound.

Any configuration, validation or serialization logic set on the generic model will also be applied to the parametrized classes, in the same way as when inheriting from a model class. Any custom methods or attributes will also be inherited.

Generic models also integrate properly with type checkers, so you get all the type checking you would expect if you were to declare a distinct type for each parametrization.

> **Note**

Internally, Pydantic creates subclasses of the generic model at runtime when the generic model class is parametrized. These classes are cached, so there should be minimal overhead introduced by the use of generics models.

To inherit from a generic model and preserve the fact that it is generic, the subclass must also inherit from Generic:

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel
TypeX = TypeVar('TypeX')
class BaseClass(BaseModel, Generic[TypeX]):
    X: TypeX
class ChildClass(BaseClass[TypeX], Generic[TypeX]):
    pass
# Parametrize `TypeX` with `int`:
print(ChildClass[int](X=1))
```
#> X=1

You can also create a generic subclass of a model that partially or fully replaces the type variables in the superclass:

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel
TypeX = TypeVar('TypeX')
TypeY = TypeVar('TypeY')
TypeZ = TypeVar('TypeZ')
class BaseClass(BaseModel, Generic[TypeX, TypeY]):
    x: TypeX
    y: TypeY
class ChildClass(BaseClass[int, TypeY], Generic[TypeY, TypeZ]):
    z: TypeZ
# Parametrize `TypeY` with `str`:
print(ChildClass[str, int](x='1', y='y', z='3'))
```
#> x=1 y='y' z=3

If the name of the concrete subclasses is important, you can also override the default name generation by overriding the model_parametrized_name() method:

```python
from typing import Any, Generic, TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel
DataT = TypeVar('DataT')
class Response(BaseModel, Generic[DataT]):
    data: DataT
    @classmethod
    def model_parametrized_name(cls, params: tuple[type[Any], ...]) -> str:
        return f'{params[0].__name__.title()}Response'
print(repr(Response[int](data=1)))
```
#> IntResponse(data=1)
print(repr(Response[str](data='a')))

You can use parametrized generic models as types in other models:

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel
T = TypeVar('T')
class ResponseModel(BaseModel, Generic[T]):
    content: T
class Product(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
class Order(BaseModel):
    id: int
    product: ResponseModel[Product]
product = Product(name='Apple', price=0.5)
response = ResponseModel[Product](content=product)
order = Order(id=1, product=response)
print(repr(order))
```
"""
Order(id=1, product=ResponseModel[Product](content=Product(name='Apple', price=0.5)))
"""

Using the same type variable in nested models allows you to enforce typing relationships at different points in your model:

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
T = TypeVar('T')
class InnerT(BaseModel, Generic[T]):
  inner: T
class OuterT(BaseModel, Generic[T]):
  outer: T
  nested: InnerT[T]
nested = InnerT[int](inner=1)
print(OuterT[int](outer=1, nested=nested))
```
#> outer=1 nested=InnerT[int](inner=1)
try:
> **Caution**

While it may not raise an error, we strongly advise against using parametrized generics in isinstance() checks.

For example, you should not do isinstance(my_model, MyGenericModel[int]). However, it is fine to do isinstance(my_model, MyGenericModel) (note that, for standard generics, it would raise an error to do a subclass check with a parameterized generic class).

If you need to perform isinstance() checks against parametrized generics, you can do this by subclassing the parametrized generic class:

class MyIntModel(MyGenericModel[int]): ...
Implementation Details
Validation of unparametrized type variables

When leaving type variables unparametrized, Pydantic treats generic models similarly to how it treats built-in generic types like list and dict:

If the type variable is bound or constrained to a specific type, it will be used.
If the type variable has a default type (as specified by PEP 696), it will be used.
For unbound or unconstrained type variables, Pydantic will fallback to Any.
```python
from typing import Generic
from typing_extensions import TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
T = TypeVar('T')
U = TypeVar('U', bound=int)
V = TypeVar('V', default=str)
class Model(BaseModel, Generic[T, U, V]):
    t: T
    u: U
    v: V
print(Model(t='t', u=1, v='v'))
```
#> t='t' u=1 v='v'
try:
> **Caution**

In some cases, validation against an unparametrized generic model can lead to data loss. Specifically, if a subtype of the type variable upper bound, constraints, or default is being used and the model isn’t explicitly parametrized, the resulting type will not be the one being provided:

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel
ItemT = TypeVar('ItemT', bound='ItemBase')
class ItemBase(BaseModel): ...
class IntItem(ItemBase):
  value: int
class ItemHolder(BaseModel, Generic[ItemT]):
  item: ItemT
loaded_data = {'item': {'value': 1}}
print(ItemHolder(**loaded_data))  
```
#> item=ItemBase()
print(ItemHolder[IntItem](**loaded_data))  
Serialization of unparametrized type variables

The behavior of serialization differs when using type variables with upper bounds, constraints, or a default value:

If a Pydantic model is used in a type variable upper bound and the type variable is never parametrized, then Pydantic will use the upper bound for validation but treat the value as Any in terms of serialization:

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel
class ErrorDetails(BaseModel):
    foo: str
ErrorDataT = TypeVar('ErrorDataT', bound=ErrorDetails)
class Error(BaseModel, Generic[ErrorDataT]):
    message: str
    details: ErrorDataT
class MyErrorDetails(ErrorDetails):
    bar: str
# serialized as Any
error = Error(
    message='We just had an error',
    details=MyErrorDetails(foo='var', bar='var2'),
```
)
assert error.model_dump() == {
# serialized using the concrete parametrization
assert error.model_dump() == {

Here’s another example of the above behavior, enumerating all permutations regarding bound specification and generic type parametrization:

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel
TBound = TypeVar('TBound', bound=BaseModel)
TNoBound = TypeVar('TNoBound')
class IntValue(BaseModel):
    value: int
class ItemBound(BaseModel, Generic[TBound]):
    item: TBound
class ItemNoBound(BaseModel, Generic[TNoBound]):
    item: TNoBound
item_bound_inferred = ItemBound(item=IntValue(value=3))
item_bound_explicit = ItemBound[IntValue](item=IntValue(value=3))
item_no_bound_inferred = ItemNoBound(item=IntValue(value=3))
item_no_bound_explicit = ItemNoBound[IntValue](item=IntValue(value=3))
# calling `print(x.model_dump())` on any of the above instances results in the following:
```
#> {'item': {'value': 3}}

However, if constraints or a default value (as per PEP 696) is being used, then the default type or constraints will be used for both validation and serialization if the type variable is not parametrized. You can override this behavior using SerializeAsAny:

```python
from typing import Generic
from typing_extensions import TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel, SerializeAsAny
class ErrorDetails(BaseModel):
    foo: str
ErrorDataT = TypeVar('ErrorDataT', default=ErrorDetails)
class Error(BaseModel, Generic[ErrorDataT]):
    message: str
    details: ErrorDataT
class MyErrorDetails(ErrorDetails):
    bar: str
# serialized using the default's serializer
error = Error(
    message='We just had an error',
    details=MyErrorDetails(foo='var', bar='var2'),
```
)
assert error.model_dump() == {
# If `ErrorDataT` was using an upper bound, `bar` would be present in `details`.
assert error.model_dump() == {
Dynamic model creation

There are some occasions where it is desirable to create a model using runtime information to specify the fields. Pydantic provides the create_model() function to allow models to be created dynamically:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, create_model
DynamicFoobarModel = create_model('DynamicFoobarModel', foo=str, bar=(int, 123))
# Equivalent to:
class StaticFoobarModel(BaseModel):
    foo: str
    bar: int = 123
```

Field definitions are specified as keyword arguments, and should either be:

A single element, representing the type annotation of the field.
A two-tuple, the first element being the type and the second element the assigned value (either a default or the Field() function).
↻
Changed in v2.11

When providing a single element for field definitions, any type can be used (previously, only an Annotated form could be provided).

Here is a more advanced example:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, PrivateAttr, create_model
DynamicModel = create_model(
    'DynamicModel',
    foo=(str, Field(alias='FOO')),
    bar=Annotated[str, Field(description='Bar field')],
    _private=(int, PrivateAttr(default=1)),
```
)
```python
class StaticModel(BaseModel):
    foo: str = Field(alias='FOO')
    bar: Annotated[str, Field(description='Bar field')]
    _private: int = PrivateAttr(default=1)
```

The special keyword arguments __config__ and __base__ can be used to customize the new model. This includes extending a base model with extra fields.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, create_model
class FooModel(BaseModel):
    foo: str
    bar: int = 123
BarModel = create_model(
    'BarModel',
    apple=(str, 'russet'),
    banana=(str, 'yellow'),
    __base__=FooModel,
```
)
print(BarModel)
print(BarModel.model_fields.keys())

You can also add validators by passing a dictionary to the __validators__ argument.

```python
from pydantic import ValidationError, create_model, field_validator
def alphanum(cls, v):
  assert v.isalnum(), 'must be alphanumeric'
  return v
validators = {
  'username_validator': field_validator('username')(alphanum)  
```
}
UserModel = create_model(
user = UserModel(username='scolvin')
try:
> **Note**

To pickle a dynamically created model:

the model must be defined globally
the __module__ argument must be provided

> **Caution**

This function may execute arbitrary code contained in field annotations, if string references need to be evaluated.

See Security implications of introspecting annotations for more information.

See also: the dynamic model example, providing guidelines to derive an optional model from another one.

RootModel and custom root types

Pydantic models can be defined with a “custom root type” by subclassing pydantic.RootModel.

The root type can be any type supported by Pydantic, and is specified by the generic parameter to RootModel. The root value can be passed to the model __init__ or model_validate via the first and only argument.

Here’s an example of how this works:

```python
from pydantic import RootModel
Pets = RootModel[list[str]]
PetsByName = RootModel[dict[str, str]]
print(Pets(['dog', 'cat']))
```
#> root=['dog', 'cat']
print(Pets(['dog', 'cat']).model_dump_json())
print(Pets.model_validate(['dog', 'cat']))
print(Pets.model_json_schema())
{'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'RootModel[list[str]]', 'type': 'array'}
"""
print(PetsByName({'Otis': 'dog', 'Milo': 'cat'}))
print(PetsByName({'Otis': 'dog', 'Milo': 'cat'}).model_dump_json())
print(PetsByName.model_validate({'Otis': 'dog', 'Milo': 'cat'}))

If you want to access items in the root field directly or to iterate over the items, you can implement custom __iter__ and __getitem__ functions, as shown in the following example.

```python
from pydantic import RootModel
class Pets(RootModel):
    root: list[str]
    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.root)
    def __getitem__(self, item):
        return self.root[item]
pets = Pets.model_validate(['dog', 'cat'])
print(pets[0])
```
#> dog
print([pet for pet in pets])

You can also create subclasses of the parametrized root model directly:

```python
from pydantic import RootModel
class Pets(RootModel[list[str]]):
    def describe(self) -> str:
        return f'Pets: {", ".join(self.root)}'
my_pets = Pets.model_validate(['dog', 'cat'])
print(my_pets.describe())
```
#> Pets: dog, cat
Faux immutability

Models can be configured to be immutable via model_config['frozen'] = True. When this is set, attempting to change the values of instance attributes will raise errors. See the API reference for more details.

> **Note**

This behavior was achieved in Pydantic V1 via the config setting allow_mutation = False. This config flag is deprecated in Pydantic V2, and has been replaced with frozen.

> **Caution**

In Python, immutability is not enforced. Developers have the ability to modify objects that are conventionally considered “immutable” if they choose to do so.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, ValidationError
class FooBarModel(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)
    a: str
    b: dict
foobar = FooBarModel(a='hello', b={'apple': 'pear'})
try:
    foobar.a = 'different'
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e)
    """
    1 validation error for FooBarModel
    a
      Instance is frozen [type=frozen_instance, input_value='different', input_type=str]
    """
print(foobar.a)
```
#> hello
print(foobar.b)
foobar.b['apple'] = 'grape'
print(foobar.b)

Trying to change a caused an error, and a remains unchanged. However, the dict b is mutable, and the immutability of foobar doesn’t stop b from being changed.

Abstract base classes

Pydantic models can be used alongside Python’s Abstract Base Classes (ABCs).

```python
import abc
from pydantic import BaseModel
class FooBarModel(BaseModel, abc.ABC):
    a: str
    b: int
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def my_abstract_method(self):
        pass
```
Field ordering

Field order affects models in the following ways:

field order is preserved in the model JSON Schema
field order is preserved in validation errors
field order is preserved when serializing data
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
class Model(BaseModel):
    a: int
    b: int = 2
    c: int = 1
    d: int = 0
    e: float
print(Model.model_fields.keys())
```
#> dict_keys(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'])
m = Model(e=2, a=1)
try:
Automatically excluded attributes
Class variables

Attributes annotated with ClassVar are properly treated by Pydantic as class variables, and will not become fields on model instances:

```python
from typing import ClassVar
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Model(BaseModel):
    x: ClassVar[int] = 1
    y: int = 2
m = Model()
print(m)
```
#> y=2
print(Model.x)
Private model attributes

Attributes whose name has a leading underscore are not treated as fields by Pydantic, and are not included in the model schema. Instead, these are converted into a “private attribute” which is not validated or even set during calls to __init__, model_validate, etc.

Here is an example of usage:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from random import randint
from typing import Any
from pydantic import BaseModel, PrivateAttr
class TimeAwareModel(BaseModel):
    _processed_at: datetime = PrivateAttr(default_factory=datetime.now)
    _secret_value: str
    def model_post_init(self, context: Any) -> None:
        # this could also be done with `default_factory`:
        self._secret_value = randint(1, 5)
m = TimeAwareModel()
print(m._processed_at)
```
#> 2032-01-02 03:04:05.000006
print(m._secret_value)

Private attribute names must start with underscore to prevent conflicts with model fields. However, dunder names (such as __attr__) are not supported, and will be completely ignored from the model definition.

New in v2.13

Default factories can take the validated model data as an argument.

Model signature

All Pydantic models will have their signature generated based on their fields:

```python
import inspect
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
class FooModel(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str = None
    description: str = 'Foo'
    apple: int = Field(alias='pear')
print(inspect.signature(FooModel))
```
#> (*, id: int, name: str = None, description: str = 'Foo', pear: int) -> None

An accurate signature is useful for introspection purposes and libraries like FastAPI or hypothesis.

The generated signature will also respect custom __init__ functions:

```python
import inspect
from pydantic import BaseModel
class MyModel(BaseModel):
    id: int
    info: str = 'Foo'
    def __init__(self, id: int = 1, *, bar: str, **data) -> None:
        """My custom init!"""
        super().__init__(id=id, bar=bar, **data)
print(inspect.signature(MyModel))
```
#> (id: int = 1, *, bar: str, info: str = 'Foo') -> None

To be included in the signature, a field’s alias or name must be a valid Python identifier. Pydantic will prioritize a field’s alias over its name when generating the signature, but may use the field name if the alias is not a valid Python identifier.

If a field’s alias and name are both not valid identifiers (which may be possible through exotic use of create_model), a **data argument will be added. In addition, the **data argument will always be present in the signature if model_config['extra'] == 'allow'.

Structural pattern matching

Pydantic supports structural pattern matching for models, as introduced by PEP 636 in Python 3.10.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
class Pet(BaseModel):
    name: str
    species: str
a = Pet(name='Bones', species='dog')
```
match a:
```python
    # match `species` to 'dog', declare and initialize `dog_name`
    case Pet(species='dog', name=dog_name):
        print(f'{dog_name} is a dog')
```
#> Bones is a dog
```python
    # default case
    case _:
        print('No dog matched')
```

> **Note**

A match-case statement may seem as if it creates a new model, but don’t be fooled; it is just syntactic sugar for getting an attribute and either comparing it or declaring and initializing it.

Attribute copies

In many cases, arguments passed to the constructor will be copied in order to perform validation and, where necessary, coercion.

In this example, note that the ID of the list changes after the class is constructed because it has been copied during validation:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
class C1:
    arr = []
    def __init__(self, in_arr):
        self.arr = in_arr
class C2(BaseModel):
    arr: list[int]
arr_orig = [1, 9, 10, 3]
c1 = C1(arr_orig)
c2 = C2(arr=arr_orig)
print(f'{id(c1.arr) == id(c2.arr)=}')
```
#> id(c1.arr) == id(c2.arr)=False

> **Note**

There are some situations where Pydantic does not copy attributes, such as when passing models — we use the model as is. You can override this behaviour by setting model_config['revalidate_instances'] = 'always'.
